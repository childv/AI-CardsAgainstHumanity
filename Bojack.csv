Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.,Humor
Mondays.,Humor
"Well, good morning to you too.",Humor
"Oh, hey.",Humor
Where? I'd love hay.,Humor
"In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around premiered on ABC.",Humor
"The show, in which a young, bachelor horse is forced to reevaluate his priorities when he agrees to raise three human children, was initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharine and not good, but the family comedy struck a chord with America and went on to air for nine seasons.",Humor
"The star of Horsin' Around, BoJack Horseman, is our guest tonight.",Humor
"Welcome, BoJack.",Humor
"It is good to be here, Charlie.",Humor
Sorry I was late.,Humor
The traffic It's really no problem.,Humor
I parked in a handicapped spot.,Humor
I hope that's okay.,Humor
"You parked in a I'm sorry, disabled spot.",Humor
Is that the proper nomenclature? Maybe you should move the car.,Humor
"No, I don't think I should drive right now.",Humor
I'm incredibly drunk.,Humor
"You're telling me that you're drunk right now? Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview? I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.",Humor
Yes.,Humor
"Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around.",Humor
"To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal? Charlie, listen, you know, I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at the time, I can tell you  Is it okay to say ""shit""?  Please don't.",Humor
Cause I I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it is.,Humor
"It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay.",Humor
"You know, because in real life Did I already say the thing about the urethra? Well, let's talk about real life.",Humor
"What have you been doing since the show's cancellation That's a great question, Charlie.",Humor
"I, uh Uh, I Um Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury! In the case of oneyearold Phoenix, you are the father.",Humor
"Morning, sunshine.",Humor
"Why so gloomy, roomie? First of all, we're not roommates.",Humor
You are my houseguest.,Humor
"Well, we don't need to put labels on things.",Humor
"You sleep on my couch, and you don't pay rent.",Humor
I've had tapeworms that were less parasitic.,Humor
I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place.,Humor
"Because my parents kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go, and even though you don't want anyone to know it You secretly have a good heart.",Humor
"You told me they didn't approve of your ""alternative lifestyle.",Humor
" I thought you were, like, a troubled gay teen or something.
I didn't realize by alternative lifestyle"" that you meant you were lazy.",Humor
That's on you for making assumptions.,Humor
"Also, if you're looking for the Toaster Strudels, I got really high last night and ate them all.",Humor
Did you say you've had tapeworms? Thanks for meeting me here.,Humor
"I would have invited you to my office, but the electric company shut off our power.",Humor
That's unfortunate.,Humor
Just an issue with the bank and a lack of money in it.,Humor
"Now, as you know, Penguin is very eager to publish your memoirs, but you keep missing your deadlines.",Humor
"I know, and I'm sorry, but I am making great progress.",Humor
"The BoJack Horseman Story, written by BoJack Horseman.",Humor
Chapter one.,Humor
Chapter one.,Humor
Chapter One.,Humor
"Look, we really need a bestseller here at Penguin.",Humor
"Things are not that great for me, money wise.",Humor
"Aren't you an editor at a major publishing house? Yeah, a publishing house.",Humor
"When was the last time you saw a book? I thought I saw someone reading one in the park the other day, but it turned out it was a takeout menu.",Humor
Whenever you're ready.,Humor
We're living month to month here.,Humor
"We're kind of counting on your autobiography to save the company, no pressure.",Humor
That's actually a lot of pressure.,Humor
"Have you considered working with a ghostwriter? Ugh, no, thank you.",Humor
"Look, just give me one more week, and I will give you some pages that'll knock your ass back to the South Pole.",Humor
I'm from Cincinnati.,Humor
It that doesn't matter.,Humor
I'll call you in a week.,Humor
"Yes, one week.",Humor
"I'm telling you, this book is a top priority for me.",Humor
"Oh, right.",Humor
Yeesh.,Humor
"You're wearing that to the prom? What, you don't think it's cute? Neigh way, Jose.",Humor
"Neigh way, Jose.
 I improvised that line.",Humor
"I mean, it was written, but I gave it the old BoJack spin.",Humor
"Hey, how many times have you watched this episode? Yeah, but do you get it, though? Because ""nay"" means no, but it's also a thing that horses say.",Humor
It works on every level.,Humor
I get it.,Humor
"Ah, you don't get it.",Humor
"Are you drunk? Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.",Humor
It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.,Humor
Yes.,Humor
"Ah, yeah, I see.",Humor
You're just bummed out because Princess Carolyn dumped you last night.,Humor
"BoJack, we need to talk.",Humor
"Hey, check out the rug on that guy.",Humor
"Slow and steady, am I right, ladies? Hachacha.",Humor
Who does he think he's fooling? Turtles don't have hair.,Humor
Stop embarrassing me.,Humor
That is Lenny Turteltaub.,Humor
"You know, I am not crazy about the bread here.",Humor
Mm.,Humor
"Why do I keep eating it? BoJack, can you please just listen for a second? You have my undivided attention.",Humor
I think we should see other people.,Humor
"Were we not seeing other people? BoJack, I'm almost there.",Humor
Wait.,Humor
Shh! Shut up.,Humor
"Now, that's a horse of a different cruller? Oh! God, that's good comedy.",Humor
"BoJack!  What? Everyone gets a mulligan, and my mulligan was Carey Mulligan.",Humor
"I'm kidding, jeez.",Humor
It was Emily Mortimer.,Humor
What is the problem here? Are you embarrassed of me because I'm a hasbeen? Because you know that I'm writing that book that is gonna make everybody love me again.,Humor
You're not really writing a book.,Humor
"Well, I already spent my advance, so that's a first step.",Humor
"Look, this has been a lot of fun, but I need to start thinking about my future.",Humor
"I mean, you don't even respect me enough to have a baby with me.",Humor
"Whoa, what? I never explicitly said that.",Humor
You said it with your actions.,Humor
"What actions? Oh, look at that baby.",Humor
"Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw? What? What? What? No, no, wha Step away from the stolen vehicle, sir! No, no, no.",Humor
"Misunderstanding, officer.",Humor
I was running away from my girlfriend whom I don't respect enough to have a baby with.,Humor
"Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? Oh, face it.",Humor
You're afraid of commitment.,Humor
I'm not afraid of commitment.,Humor
I commit to things all the time.,Humor
It's the following through on that commitment that I take issue with.,Humor
"Hey, stupid, isn't that your friend over there? Oh, Mr.",Humor
"Peanutbutter? God, I hope he doesn't see us.",Humor
"Is that BoJack Horseman? Oh, jeez, here we go.",Humor
Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same room.,Humor
"What is this, a crossover episode? You know, that gets funnier every time.",Humor
"You're being sarcastic, but I think it does actually get funnier every time.",Humor
"We're actually in the middle of breaking up right now,  so if you could just  Yeah?  You're in the middle of it?  Yeah, that's right.",Humor
"So would it be awkward if I joined you right now? Yes, actually, it's very awkward.",Humor
"Is that not clear? Yeah, this is awkward right now? Yes, please leave.",Humor
"How are you, Mr.",Humor
"Peanutbutter? Oh, living the dream, P.",Humor
C.,Humor
", living the dream.",Humor
"Why are you making conversation? Oh, let's see, it's the English word It's called being polite, BoJack.",Humor
"But am I crazy that this is a bad time? Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh, BoJack? What? You'll get that one later, man.",Humor
"Erica, get out of here with that face.",Humor
Would it kill you to be civil? This is why we're breaking up.,Humor
"So it's not because of the thing with the baby? It's because of a lot of things! Waiter, could we please have the check?  Thank you.",Humor
We haven't even ordered yet.,Humor
"I have wasted so many dinners on you, BoJack Horseman.",Humor
I don't know how you can expect anyone else to love you when you so clearly hate yourself.,Humor
Here you go.,Humor
Let me see that.,Humor
$10 for bread? I don't want to live in a society where the premeal bread isn't free.,Humor
It is free if you order a meal.,Humor
"Can you take me home, please? Yeah, but I didn't even eat that much bread.",Humor
"What did I have? I must have had You ate nine baskets, sir.",Humor
"Nine really? Great, now I'm gonna feel like a fat ass all week.",Humor
You've seen me naked.,Humor
Do you think I'm getting chubby? You want to know the real reason we're breaking up? What was that? Sorry.,Humor
Couldn't hear you over the sound of my calories not metabolizing.,Humor
This is so classic you.,Humor
You're using this bread thing to avoid talking about our relationship.,Humor
"No, that is definitely not happening.",Humor
I'd like to go home now.,Humor
You think I'm fat.,Humor
"So yeah, technically I was dumped, but the real headline of the evening was, ""Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end.",Humor
" What kind of headline is that? Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago? God damn it! Stop the presses.
You're not fat.
Oh, hey, let's throw a party.
That'll cheer you up.
No, it won't.
It'll cheer you up.
I'll stand in the corner by myself eating cotton candy until I barf like I did at your last party.
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? That was a good party.
Hey, didn't we get a cotton candy machine for that party? Who told you Princess Carolyn and I broke up?  She did.
 What? You never took me home, jerk! Oh, everything's my fault.
Take me home.
Okay, jeez.
But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.
I'll slow the car down to a crawl, and you can duck and roll.
You know what, you can take a last look at this face, because it's the last time you're gonna see it.
Heyup! Hello? I've got Princess Carolyn for you.
Uh, okay.
BoJack.
Oh, my God, we just broke up.
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.
I pride myself on my ability to separate my professional life from my personal life.
Great.
Then, as my agent, do you think I'm getting fat? No way.
You are in the prime of your life, never looked better.
What about as my exgirlfriend? You look like a pile of crap ate a second pile of crap and then crapped out a third pile of crap.
Wait, wait, so which pile of crap do I look like?  The third one.
 What? That's the worst one.
I'm not calling you as your ex.
I'm calling you as your agent.
Remember that book you're pretending to write? Well, Penguin wants an update on your progress.
Does Tuesday work for you, or are you gonna be too busy this week masturbating to old pictures of yourself? I told you, that's not what was happening that time.
I was masturbating to what the picture represented.
You walked in at the worst possible moment! So, Tuesday, though? Yes, fine! Whoo! You don't have anything? Hey, you got the electricity back.
Good for you.
This company is in dire straits.
We made a series of very bad investments.
Ever hear of a young adult franchise called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu? Uh, no.
Then why did we spend $20 million on marketing? It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.
Uh Look, I know you're a busy guy.
Actually, I am a busy guy.
I live a very active lifestyle.
Can't I just stay home with you? I know kindergarten is scary, but you're a big girl now, and you have to be brave.
Okay, Daddy.
Wait, did you just call me Daddy""? Little Sabrina grew up right before our eyes, right, Todd? Todd? Todd! What? Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes? Yes! We're tired of waiting.",Humor
We're hiring you a ghostwriter.,Humor
"Diane ""Nugent""? She's great, and she's got a thing for horses.",Humor
Check this out.,Humor
"Hey, Secretariat.",Humor
"You know, I always wanted to play Secretariat in a movie.",Humor
He's kind of my personal hero.,Humor
"Could never get the project off the ground, though.",Humor
"I mean, there was this one time I came close in the '90s, and people got tired of seeing running onscreen.",Humor
Don't tell me.,Humor
Tell her! She's cute.,Humor
Call her.,Humor
"That's a loan, by the way.",Humor
"We can't afford to be giving out free books to people, but you can take anything you want from the Swamp Monsters swag box.",Humor
"Oh, God, I'm a failure.",Humor
"Oh, you're not a failure.",Humor
Why did I say I could write a book? Because you have an amazing story to tell.,Humor
Relax.,Humor
"Relax? Easy for you to say, you hippie.",Humor
You've never had a day of stress in your life.,Humor
Ow.,Humor
Why? And that's for trying to sell E on the cartel's turf.,Humor
"Oh, where's Gabriela? She went back to Mexico City, ese, to be with her husband.",Humor
"What? No!  Gabriela, why?  Who? We were talking about me.",Humor
"Can you try to focus for, like, a second? Oh, yeah, sorry.",Humor
You were saying? Never should have signed this book deal.,Humor
You know what my problem is? I can't say no to people because I want everyone to like me.,Humor
"You want everyone to like you? Yeah, why? Do people not like me? Uh Uh What were we talking about? I can see the headline now, ""Stupid BoJack writes a stupid book about his stupid life, nobody cares.",Humor
" What newspapers are you reading? Hey, why don't you just let that lady write your book and be done with it? Better question, why are you in my kitchen? I'm making breakfast.
We had sex last night, dummy.
Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone on airplane mode when I drink.
This lady probably thinks I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.
I hate her and her stupid, impossibletopronounce last name, Nagooyagogoogoogooga.
You haven't even met her.
Give her a chance.
Oh, you should invite her to the party.
What party? Why are you so obsessed with throwing a party all of a sudden? Ow, ow, ow! You know how much money we lost 'cause of you? I can't even afford a hall now for my daughter's 15th birthday, and now I got a hundred guests coming and nowhere to put them.
You owe me a party, cabrÃ³n, and if you don't deliver Because parties are fun? This book is really important to me.
I don't want to just hand it off to some stranger.
If it's so important, why have you written literally nothing in a year and a half? It's too much pressure.
This book is my one shot at preserving my legacy.
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good, I'm gonna be a joke forever.
Everyone thinks that I'm just this washedup hack, but actually Oh, God, actually, what if they're right? I can't breathe.
Am I dying? Toast.
I smell burning toast! Oh, my God, my toast! Todd, on my grave, I want it to say that I was born in 1975.
No one's gonna believe Damn it, can't you respect a dying man's wish? You're not dying.
Well, we did everything we could.
Nurse, record the time of death.
It doesn't get easier.
It never gets easier.
What I don't What do you mean he's dead? That's right, sweetheart.
He died of a broken heart because you didn't appreciate him enough, and now he's gone forever.
We might have gone too dark on that series finale.
I'm required to hand you over to the child protective services.
You're the state's problem now.
No! Do you just take those DVDs with you everywhere you go? Linus walked around with a blanket.
No one gave him shit for it.
How long is that doctor going to take? I have a meeting with another client at 3:00.
You have other clients? No, I make a living off you sitting on your ass all day.
Are your other clients more talented than I am? Your silence speaks volumes.
Well, BoJack, it looks like what you experienced was a mild anxiety attack.
Jesus, if that's mild, I don't want to know what spicy feels like.
Too smart for the room? It was a salsa joke, people.
You've been overstressed.
I need you to take it easy.
Take it easy, are you kidding? He doesn't have a job.
He has no real responsibilities.
He doesn't do anything but take it easy.
Well, can you take it even easier? I can try, doctor.
I can try.
This book deal is obviously stressing you out.
Will you just call the ghostwriter already? What, you want me to call this woman on the phone? Well, you just had another anxiety attack.
And Entertainment Weekly said I wasn't consistent.
Really, not even a pity laugh? I did almost die.
Ha.
I have to check on some other patients.
You have other patients? BoJack, let's have a party, okay? I'll organize the whole thing.
You can invite the ghostwriter and have a nice, casual conversation in a fun, pressurefree environment.
Okay, fine.
We'll have a party.
Oh, thank God.
But we're not getting a cotton candy machine.
I can't control myself around those things.
I totally hear what you are saying, and I will do my best.
SeÃ±or Horseman, I will never forget your generosity today.
You have made a powerful ally for life.
Mwah.
Let's dance! Todd, who was that guy? Who are all these people? Oh, you know, just a variety of folks from all walks of life.
Is this a quinceaÃ±era? Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls is a quinceaÃ±era? Now who's racist? I find that piÃ±ata offensive.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present.
BoJack! Oh, good Lord.
Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Can you believe this, the two of us in the same house? Is this a crossover episode? No, I'm just kidding around, man.
Seriously, though, how are you? Well, I've been kind of up and Living the dream, huh? Yeah.
Hey, we'll catch up later, all right? I want to talk to you.
Erica, how are you looking so beautiful? I'm furious.
Hey, BoJack, right?  BoJack Horseman?  Yes.
Oh, I'm I'm sorry, I don't want to mispronounce your name.
It's Diane.
Oh, Diane.
Thanks for inviting me to your party.
Sorry I haven't really been mingling.
I get kind of awkward at parties.
 Have you tried alcohol?  I don't know.
Parties make me anxious in a real broad sense.
Like, look at that guy.
He's having fun.
Why haven't I figured it out? What guy? No, there's no guy there.
I'm just saying, like, a guy, you know? Oh, okay, yeah.
I'm probably just overthinking it because I never got the practice because I didn't get invited to any parties in high school.
What am I talking about? You don't care about any of that.
Shut up, Diane.
You're at a party, compliment the host.
You have a lovely home.
Yeah, well, if you're gonna throw away most of your adult life on some dumb sitcom, you might as well get a sweet house out of the deal, right? So what are you working on these days? Well, mostly I just sit around the house and complain about things.
Yeah, how's that working out for you? I can't complain, so you know.
No, I will not have sex with you! This girl wants me to have sex with her.
No, I'm just kidding around.
You're a good sport.
 Ugh, you know who that is?  Mr.
Peanutbutter? Yeah, he was on that show Mr.
Peanutbutter's House about that dog who adopted the three human kids.
What a dumb idea for a TV show.
You people are all right.
Who wants an autograph? He's so stupid he doesn't realize how miserable he should be.
I envy that.
Hey, do you know the story of the dad from The Brady Bunch? Do I know his story? If I recall correctly, he was bringing up three boys of his own.
Right, but They were four men living all together, but they were all alone.
That is profoundly sad.
No, the story is that the guy who played the dad hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor, and he considered it beneath him.
Sound familiar? That's not all that was beneath him.
Gay joke.
Sorry, I'm better than that.
Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives.
You're actually in a really good position now, because you can pretty much do anything you want.
You're responsible for your own happiness, you know?  Good Lord, that's depressing.
 No, it's not.
I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.
Todd! I need help.
What would make you happy? Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.
Is that all? I can help you with that.
Yeah? I mean, would you even want to? You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.
You'd probably get sick of me.
I don't think that's going to happen.
 No?  No, BoJack.
Okay.
Well, then I guess you're hired, but don't put all that stuff about how sad I am in the book.
Oh, that doesn't count.
We weren't on the clock yet.
Yeah, exactly.
You're only my ghostwriter starting nah  Starting now.
 You got it.
 BoJack!  Ugh, this guy.
Hey, man, wanted to let you know, you are out of beer.
Oh, I see you've met my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.
You drank all my beer?  Also, you two are dating?  Yeah.
 You're dating him?  Yes.
This is your boyfriend?  That is correct.
 Uhhuh.
 You are going out with you?  Uhhuh.
But in a sexual way, not just as friends?  That's right.
 You have seen her naked.
Many times, yes.
 You are attracted to this?  Yes.
This penis has been inside this vagina.
 Yep.
 But in a sexual way.
Oh, yes.
Humph.
 Ugh.
 Oh, my God.
Are you okay? I'm just I'm fine.
I'm just I'm really happy for you.
Should we get someone, or No, everything's Oh, this is really Wonderful.
Oh, God.
Starting now.
Boxer versus raptor.

Say when.
When.
Yeah, you'll never guess who's here.
Think '90s.
No, BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around.
No, I mean, he got a little fatter, but it's definitely him.
He looks really sad.
It's hilarious.
Get over here now.
I told you, I don't know where it is.
Don't put things in my butt if you want them back.
And hold for Princess Carolyn, please.
Thanks, Laura.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d d Jellicles do and Jelli d BoJack, it's your favorite agent.
Yeah, some agent, you couldn't even get me in the room for War Horse.
There were, like, ten horses in that movie.
I didn't need to be the warhorse.
Listen, dummy, I want to make sure you're all set for your first day with Diane tomorrow.
Is she gonna ask me a bunch of personal questions? The woman we're paying to ghostwrite your memoir? Yeah, probably.
Okay, all right, there's no need to get What, catty? Are you gonna say catty?  I was not gonna say catty.
 Oh, what were you gonna say? I was gonna say catty because you're a cat.
Goodbye, BoJack.
Laura, I know you're listening.
You got it, right? Laura, do not respond to him.
Goodbye, BoJack.
She got it.
Oh, my God.
Take another one.
Take another one.
Excuse me, I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight, and I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it.
Excuse me? I was actually already in a bad mood, but I thought maybe for one night, I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself, but now because of you and your friends, I feel more selfconscious than ever.
If we were bothering you so much, why didn't you just leave? Because I didn't think of that, and now I feel stupid.
Look, I have a right to be here.
No! Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away with things, but I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others, and I hate you, and you are a horrible person, and you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person.
You think I'm pretty? Well, that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices.
What'd you say? I was tweeting about all the weird stuff you do in bed.
 Good morning.
 Ah! Why are you here? I slept here.
Yeah, but why are you still here? Breakfast.
That better not be my last Toaster Strudel.
No, there were three left.
Well, get out of here.
My memoirist is gonna show up soon, and I don't need you  What's your name?  Pam.
I don't need you Paming up the place when she gets here.
 Hey, BoJack.
 Ah! Why are you here?  You told me to come at 9:00.
 That doesn't sound like me.
I have your email right here.
Diane, why don't you come over Tuesday morning at 9:00? Also, you should bring this email with you because I might not remember it because I just took a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha ha.",Humor
"Also, please don't put in my book that I use horse tranquilizers, ha ha.",Humor
"I just use a small dose to help me fall asleep at night and then a much, much larger dose to get me through the day.",Humor
"Also, I'm drunk.",Humor
"Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone.",Humor
"Please don't put that in my book, book, book, book 'em, dildo.",Humor
"Does it taste like magenta in here?"" Then I think you fell asleep on the keyboard because it just says the letter ""B"" 27 times.",Humor
That does sound like me.,Humor
"Well, anyway, this is my businessperson Excuse me? Here to help me with some business needs.",Humor
All very above board.,Humor
"Uh, what'd you say? No need to mention her in the book either, unless it's a business book.",Humor
"Ha ha, classic BoJack.",Humor
"Why are you here? Oh, funny story, I'm filming a reality show later, so I thought I'd drop by with the old tennis ball and chain.",Humor
That is neither funny nor a story nor a reason for you to drop by.,Humor
"Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag about his reality show.",Humor
"Get this, I am starring in a pilot presentation for a celebrity reality show.",Humor
"It's pretty cutting edge, huh? Yeah, if it's 2003.",Humor
Ha ha.,Humor
Don't tell VH1 that.,Humor
"Seriously, though, please don't tell VH1 that.",Humor
We are calling it Peanutbutter and Jelly.,Humor
Get it?  Because I'm Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter.,Humor
"Okay, who's jelly? No, no, no.",Humor
It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.,Humor
It's wordplay.,Humor
"You may have too forgiving a definition of the word ""wordplay.",Humor
" Well, it's a working title.
Well, it could be working harder, and that's wordplay.
How'd you even get in here? Your roommate let us in.
Mi casa es su casa.
And that is the last of the Toaster Strudels, and now my morning is ruined.
Could you guys keep it down, okay? I'm kind of on a date right now.
In America, I am actually considered very handsome.
Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast, and when I get back, I want everyone out of my house except for you and you and  Who are you again?  The girl you had sex with.
Right.
You definitely should have already been gone.
I really shouldn't eat chocolate 'cause it can literally kill me.
Oh, I know.
 But I love chocolate.
 Story of my life.
Hey, excuse me.
Yes, I am BoJack Horseman, star of Horsin' Around.
Yeah, okay, I don't care.
Those are my muffins.
I'm sorry, I I don't understand.
Did you bring them into the store with you? No, but I was going to buy them.
That's the last box, and I had dibs on them.
Really? You had dibs? Yeah, dibs.
I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom.
Look, I don't even want the muffins.
I was just looking at them, but I got to say, if you put muffins down, they're not your muffins.
So what, I was supposed to take them into the bathroom with me? You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.
You just left them out here.
Yeah, in the produce section.
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section.
That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs? Look, I don't want to get into a whole thing here.
Then give me the muffins.
No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.
You think that because you're a pseudocelebrity, normal rules don't apply to you? Pseudo? Would you say that to Eric McCormack? Look, I've had a rough morning, so I don't need You've had a rough morning? I spent the last ten months Hey! Sorry, wasn't listening.
See ya.
You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman.
Oh, really? I'm gonna regret buying muffins? What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them? Oh, man, they do have a lot of saturated fat.
Why'd I buy these? Man, I really regret buying those muffins and then eating them all on the drive home.
Well, my date with Ayako went really well.
Thanks for asking.
I specifically didn't ask, and I'll thank you to respect my total lack of interest in your personal life.
She's hilarious.
I never met a girl who was so curious about American bank routing numbers.
Still not interested.
Should we get started on the book? What's your hurry? What do you guys think I should get Ayako for our 12hour anniversary? She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name.
Okay, let's get to work.
Let's start at the beginning.
What was your childhood like?  Normal.
 Normal? Yeah, it was, uh, normal normal childhood stuff.
Here's your omelet.
I'm sorry it's not as good as the omelets your secretary makes, but then you're not married to your secretary, are you? Well, maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion, I would be.
Mommy, can I have an omelet? You're the birthday boy.
Normal childhood, and then just get right into the big, famous part.
Look, if you're not ready to talk, we can wait.
I am ready to talk.
Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents? They're so normal.
That's crazy.
You sound like a crazy person, not me.
Stop being so crazy, crazy.
Why are you calling me crazy? Okay.
Was your father Hold on, I got to take this.
Hello? Hey, BoJack, I've got Princess Carolyn for you.
 It's urgent.
 Great, put her on.
Just a sec.
I'll see if she's available.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And d BoJack, are you watching MSNBSea right now? Great question.
Well, I didn't fall down on my remote, randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea while simultaneously crippling myself, thus physically forcing me to watch MSNBSea, so no.
No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.
Yeah, well, Hamlet, you might want to turn it on.
They're talking about you.
Ooh! Good things, I hope.
Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal, a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.
Welcome to the program, Neal.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, I met this guy.
All Neal wanted when he got home and I emphasize, from Afghanistan was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins.
When he went to the supermarket and called dibs on the last box Well, tell us what happened, Neal.
BoJack Horseman, from the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around, refused to respect my dibs.
Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman? Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.
Oh, not the sneezing pic Why do they always use the sneezing picture? In the '90s, we laughed at your antics.
Oh, how we laughed.
Ha ha ha,"" we chortled in rapturous glee.",Humor
"But when you deny the dibs called by our men and women on the frontlines, that is a sick joke, sir.",Humor
"A sick, sick joke, indeed, and you'll forgive me if I chortle no longer, for, to me, there is nothing the least bit funny about stealing a meal from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.",Humor
"Wait, wait, you stole muffins from a Navy SEAL? I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL.",Humor
I just thought he was the regular kind of seal.,Humor
This is classic Hollywood elitism.,Humor
"BoJack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV, that makes him better than everybody.",Humor
"Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV, so now I'm better than everybody! That's right, Neal.",Humor
"You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow.",Humor
"You guys think I should call in and set the record straight? BoJack, these people feed off controversy.",Humor
"If you dignify the story with a response, it's just gonna fan I'm now receiving word that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.",Humor
"Sorry, stopped listening.",Humor
"You were ramping up to a ""yes,"" right? BoJack, what you did today was a slap in the face of America's heroes.",Humor
"Will you apologize? Okay, enough about America's heroes.",Humor
Can we talk about dibs? Because he didn't even really have dibs.,Humor
"If he had legitimate dibs Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.",Humor
I hid them in the produce section! You left them totally out in the open.,Humor
"That's hiding? How did you survive in Afghanistan? Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins! Hey, guess what, I can't give them back 'cause I ate them all, okay? Dude.",Humor
"Hold on, just to be clear, since this morning, you ate all the muffins? Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting because I have no selfcontrol and I hate myself.",Humor
"Is that what you want to hear? Neal, was it a small container of muffins, like two to four muffins? No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that.",Humor
"Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box? Yeah, there were exactly 12! I ate 12 muffins, and I didn't even want one! There's your goddamn news story, the mystery of my missing goddamn selfrespect! How'd I come off? Well, that went slightly better than the worst it could have possibly gone, so hooray? It's not even about the muffins.",Humor
Everyone is just out to get me because I'm famous and so welladjusted.,Humor
"Well, at least you've got some privacy.",Humor
My boyfriend's filming a reality show at our house.,Humor
"If I want to be alone, I have to go to the roof because it's the only place they don't have insurance to film.",Humor
"You go on the roof? Yeah, just to get some work done.",Humor
"Is that really weird? No, it's adorable.",Humor
"When I was a kid, I used to climb onto the roof with my dad and look at the stars.",Humor
"What about you? Were you close with your father? Happy Father's Day, Daddy.",Humor
"What is this supposed to be, a lima bean? It's a heart.",Humor
"That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.",Humor
I tried my best.,Humor
"No, you didn't.",Humor
You slacked off and took the easy way out.,Humor
"In this world, you can either do things the easy way or the right way.",Humor
"You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat? Um, the canal? You go around the horn the way God intended! Uneventful.",Humor
"What?  What? I asked if you were close with your father, and you sat here in silence for five minutes and then said, ""Uneventful.",Humor
" You know what, this is a really good conversation, and I definitely want to keep having it, but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing, so maybe we could put a pin in this thorough deconstruction of my past, so I can put that other thing to bed before it spirals out of con I had dibs!  My dibs were on those muffins!  Your dibs were void! I spent a year in Afghanistan making America safer, and this is the thanks I get? Really, you, specifically, made America safer? Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree that the troops are heroes.
I don't agree to that.
Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically.
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.
Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.
What? Did you just say you think the troops are jerks? Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you? I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.
No, no, no.
 The troops are jerks?  Oh, God.
Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun Hello? Princess Carolyn needs to talk to you immediately.
Great, put her on.
She's actually just getting out of a meeting.
 Can you hold for a sec?  You called me.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d Ugh.
d Jellicles would And Jellicles can d  BoJack.
 Ah! I'm gonna level with you, honey.
This whole you hating the troops thing is not great.
I don't hate the troops.
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.
I just think that he's wrong about the muffins.
I know, BoJack just like always, you're right, and everyone else is wrong.
But if you don't swallow your pride, this is never gonna let up.
 I know you're stubborn  I'm not stubborn.
 I'm proud.
 That's kind of the same thing.
No, it's an important distinction.
Okay, fine.
You're not stubborn.
But I'm about to tell you something very important, so I want you to listen carefully.
I'm getting another call.
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.
d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d It is now day three of the great BoJack jerkoff Really? That's the name we came up with for this? Who came up with that? Was it Randy? Did Randy come up with that? Anyway, the former television actor who hates our troops has not left his home since his controversial remarks on Monday about how he hates the troops.
BoJack Horseman makes me sick.
He voiced his opinion, even though it was unpopular, and that's the most cowardly thing a person can do.
After we made love, he covered himself in sheets like an Arab.
At this very moment, Congress is voting on a major education bill that could completely restructure the Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we've got some big news on the BoJack Horseman front.
It appears that BoJack's Lexus is coming out of the garage.
This is very big news, indeed.
Any comment on BoJack's controversial remarks this week? Uh, nope.
So where are we going? Don't worry, I've got a plan.
Whoa! Jeez.
Ayako, hey, I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto.
_ _ _ _ _ Hey, I meant I was rich because I have friends like George Bailey.
_ _ _ Hello? Well, I'm out of ideas.
We can hide out at my place while we make a plan.
Yeah, great, just get me away from the cameras.
Do we really need to be filming this? It's for my reality show.
You never know when gold's gonna strike.
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.
That's why you never know.
BoJack, be nice.
Just pretend they're not there.
Okay.
Well, I Could you speak up, please?  I'd like to  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's too loud.
I want to fix this as quickly as possible.
I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore, even though I was definitely right.
I just want my privacy back, so I can finish writing my tellall memoir, so everyone will pay attention to me again.
I've already reached out to the McBeal camp.
He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize and present to him a box of muffins as a symbol of your great admiration for the American military and everything they do.
But I ate the muffins.
I know.
We got another box.
It's in the cupboard.
Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.
We've been here for ten minutes! It's okay, we'll get more muffins.
I'll get the muffins, and they're on me.
I just found out I got I'm helping! Hooray! So where are we gonna do this? Do I have to go on MSNBSea? No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.
Oh, why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly? You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly if there's no jelly.
It's a pun.
It's not a pun if it only works one way.
Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now? Look, I know tempers are high, but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality show, which we all agree is really clever.
We can edit this to make me look smart, right? d Yeah d  d Peanutbutter d  d Come on d How's this look? Looks good?  Okay.
 Marker, sound, speed.
Well, here I am, hanging out with my good friend BoJack Horseman, enjoying each other's company, as we often do.
Yes, this is all very authentic and natural.
Oh, someone's at the door! I will see who it is.
Wow, this is a surprise.
Neal McBeal.
Hello, sir.
Thank you for inviting me into your home.
It is lovely.
BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal? Ahem.
Oh, yeah, Todd? What the hell is this? I tried to buy the muffins, but my bank card got declined for some reason.
But don't worry, I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.
I'm sorry? Yeah, they're just giving them away behind InNOut.
Why does anybody pay for anything? Ow.
Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration, please accept this bag of stale hamburger buns.
 What?  Yes, hamburger buns.
It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash, sadly, far too often.
I'm listening.
We send our muffins overseas, and they come back as stale hamburger buns, but that doesn't mean we should love them any less, because in their own way, aren't stale hamburger buns just as good? Mmm.
American made.
So what you're saying is, you think I'm a hero.
Well, I don't know if I Say it, BoJack.
Say I'm a hero.
You're a hero.
The troops are all heroes, every single one.
Great.
And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns.
Okay, you can let go of the bag now.
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.
Yeah, me neither.
I think we're in agreement here.
Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.
Okay.
And finally, I don't Hey, look, Mr.
Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.
Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am? Hey, where'd he get that bucket from? Who gave him a bucket? Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make.
Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? Come on.
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Hey, can anyone find a handle? Oh, thank you, my friend.
You're a real hero.
Unbelievable.
What's your name, young lady? Well, my real name's Angela, but my friends call me Jelly.
What? Oh, my God, did we get that? Please tell me we got that.
You want a dayold hamburger bun? I'm all right.
How'd it go down there? You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe.
No one ever wants to hear the truth.
I want to hear the truth.
I don't know if you want to tell it, though.
What do you mean? Mr.
Normal Childhood, Mr.
Uneventful Father? Look, I can write you the standard emptycalorie celebrity tellsome, if that's what you're looking for, but I thought you might want more than that.
I do.
Well, then you're going to have to open up and give me something real.
What, you think I can't open up? Well, I don't know if you can or not.
You certainly haven't.
Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all.
You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you? I don't know, are you an asshole? Okay, full truth, here we go.
You want to know about my parents? They drank a lot.
My father was a failed novelist.
My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for it.
He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records.
He made me build my own tree house, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty, Christian nails, I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails.
Like I said, totally normal.

I'll probably just go to the amusement park, maybe the circus, fly a kite on the beach, watch the sunset, then I'll head back to my place to watch any number of Disney princess movies while eating ice cream straight from the tub.
Whoa, that sounds like so much fun.
Can I come? Yeah, like I want to spend my weekend hanging out with a little girl.
Good one! You should write for the Shouts and Murmurs.
See you Monday! So the makeup they were putting on you was not for the show, it was just for the weekend?  Why does that matter?  I'm just trying to understand the story.
Do you think it's possible that you inviting Sarah Lynn into your house now is your way of compensating for not No, Diane, I'm just helping out a friend.
I'm not trying to play out some weird, sick dad fantasy, or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect, or even try to retroactively fix my own childhood by recreating someone else's, and I'm especially not doing all those things at once! Okay.
What happened? Did somebody hurt my precious baby? Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the ? Oh, hey, BoJack.
I told my friends they could tear this wall out to build a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet.
 Is that cool?  No, that's not cool.
Oof.
Way to harsh the vibe, Kissinger.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn could finally be Sarah Lynn, but I guess  that's too much, man.
 I always loved that catch phrase.
Can your friends at least take the artwork off the wall first? Ooh.
I want to say yes, but no.
 Okay, good talk.
 Wha Are you serious? The reason I have called this house meeting is Todd, how many times have we been over this? You don't have the authority to call house meetings.
Only I can call a house meeting.
You can propose a house meeting.
All right, fine, fine, fine, but the reason I propose  this house meeting  Your proposal has been submitted and is under board review.
 Proposal denied.
 BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing is getting out of control, okay? She's taking advantage of you.
What? No she's not.
We have a special relationship.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Oh, my God.
Look at what she's done to your house.
All right, look, I mean, I stepped on a needle earlier.
I think I'm addicted to heroin now, so now, that's probably gonna be a whole thing.
I have to say, I agree with Todd.
You're not this girl's father, and you're not doing her any favors by refusing to set boundaries.
Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV, so I think I know a little bit more about parenting than you two jokers.
The kids on Horsin' Around didn't need boundaries.
All they needed was some good, oldfashioned love.
BoJack! This is not a TV show, okay? This is real life.
Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire! Some good, oldfashioned love, and I'm gonna give it to her.
I'm gonna give it to her so hard.
You know, I feel like we don't ever hang out.
Here you are, milady, a gin and nutmeg just like you asked.
Ugh.
Too much nutmeg.
Well, you know what would taste even better? An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt.
Could Vanessa Gecko get you that? Vanessa Gecko got Andrew The Social Network, and she has skybox seats at the Staples Center.
 What do you have?  Well, I've got a table at the Comedy Central roast of Gloria Stein Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say we spend the day together, just you and me, away from all the haters?  I want to say yes, but  Great, let's go.
It really seems like Some things are forever in this world Don't you know I'm feeling fine together with my girl Daddy's girl She's daddy's girl You know, Sarah Lynn, I got a feeling  everything's gonna be okay.
 Uhhuh.
Hey, did you hear Kazaz got cancer? What? Herb Kazaz has cancer? Yeah, in the butt.
He's got, like, six months I think.
Well, that's horrible.
Why would you tell me that now? I don't know.
The sun setting over those two hills made me think of a big ass, and that made me think of ass cancer, and that made me think of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer.
You really didn't know? No, Herb and I aren't on the best Look, I'm trying to have a moment here.
I can't Hey, I want to give you something.
 Is this your TV Guide award?  It's the most prestigious award I ever won.
I always thought if I ever had kids of my own, I'd give it to them one day.
I want you to have it.
Oh, wow.
BoJack, thanks.
You're sweet.

I put my name on, it's like I won it myself! I have two Golden Globes and a People's Choice forTemple Grandin.

Hey, BoJack, settle a bet.
 Are you a Zoe or a Zelda?  Don't know what that means.
Well, I was talking to Wayne.
 Who's Wayne?  I'm Wayne.
Wayne's writing an article about me for BuzzFeed.
BuzzFeed? What'll they think of next? Fun fact: Wayne is also my exboyfriend.
You're funny.
Pretty cool, eh, BoJack? Diane's writing a book about you, Wayne's writing an article about me.
We're the same! How could you think that that's the same? My book will be in libraries for hundreds of years.
Your BuzzFeed article will be crammed between an animated GIF of a cat falling asleep and a list of fun facts about Legally Blonde.
 Ha! Classic Zoe.
 I still don't know what that means.
Well, are you familiar with Mr.
Peanutbutter's House? Do you mean his sitcom that coincidentally had the exact same premise as my sitcom? Not the exact same.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's House featured a pair of twins, Zoe and Zelda.
Zelda was the sunny, funloving extrovert.
 Look at my pumpkin, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
 Pretty smile, Zellybelly.
Aww Whereas Zoe was the smart, cynical introvert.
My pumpkin's throwing up because Halloween encourages excessive consumption of refined sugar at a time when obesity rates are sky high.
Plus, Halloween costumes are a gateway to casual racism.
Why don't I keep the knife, Zobo? Who's that dog? Mr.
Peanutbutter Knickknack, paddywhack Give a dog a bone Now, was the show's acting hamfisted and the writing moronic?  Nnno?  Yes, but the Zoe/Zelda paradigm rang true.
I believe everyone's either a Zoe or a Zelda.
For example, Nixon was a Zoe and Kennedy, a Zelda.
Al Gore, Zoe.
George W.
Bush, total Zelda.
It's R2D2 and C3PO, Zooey and Emily Deschanel.
So Zooey's a Zoe? No, Zooey's a Zelda.
Emily's the Zoe.
What a crazy world.
 So which one are you, BoJack?  I think I'm above this.
Said the Zoe.
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.
Or maybe you're the third kind of person, whose only function is to drain the energy and life force  from his host organism.
 Come on, BoJack.
Nah, he's right.
I'm pretty much worthless.
See? You say something to someone enough times, and eventually, he internalizes it.
The system works.
I don't have a job, I don't have any prospects.
I probably won't ever finish the rock opera I'm working on.
What? Since when are you working on a rock opera? Oh, no.
Why'd I ask that? Basically, it's Tommy by way of Cirque du Soleil set in space, with heavy erotic overtones, and the gripping psychodrama of a thriller with plenty of heart and more than a little humor.
I call it Newtopia Rising, Book 1:  The Search for a New Utopia.
 Book 1? You've got me thinking sequel here.

Now, you have to understand that as a port city, Liverpool had unique access to all aspects of American culture, especially Blues music and its unruly nephew, Rock and Roll.
I thought this story was about running into Paul McCartney in the bathroom at the Golden Globes.
It is.
I thought you would appreciate some context.
Let's skip that one for a minute.
 Tell me about Todd.
 Todd? What's to tell? Five years ago, he found his way into one of my house parties and never left.
And you've never asked him anything about himself? I've asked him to get a job, I've asked him to move out.
With a little encouragement, I'll bet he could really flourish.
I mean, didn't you have anyone who helped you  when you were just starting out?  Um, actually, no.
Todd clearly thinks the world of you.
Todd thinks the world of PopTarts.
Look, I get that helping other people is not your thing, but What? I let Todd live rentfree in my stately manse.
I am his own personal Mother Teresa.
But do you let him stay here because you're kind or just because you're terrified of being alone? That is insane! I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.
Mmm if that were really true, I don't think you'd be clipping Todd's wings all the time.
What? That's unbelievable.
 Todd!  What? Clean up my shit? Yes, but also, I would like to help you with your dumbass rock opera.
 What?  I am supporting you.
II don't understand.
Oh, my God, are you dying? No.
I think you have great depth of untapped potential and I wish to mentor you in your art.
 Really?  Yes.
Wait, is this going to be like that time you promised to take me ice skating, and I got really excited about the ice skating, but then instead of ice skating, you left me at home so you could go to the strip club and then you took the strippers ice skating?  No.
 Then hooray! Let's dig in.
Where to start? Okay, well, the headline is, I hate it.
I hate everything about it.
The premise is bad and the execution is also bad.
It's an irredeemable jumble of shit.
 Tough but fair.
 Ahem.
That said, I don't see why we can't make something really great here.
Okay, thank you.
I'll work on that.
 Are you close?  No!  How 'bout now?  No!  Now?  You're not even inside of me.
Oh, God! Did you get there? Okay, so you know in the second act closer when the seekers of Newtopia are in the Turbidians' dungeon and they learn their ship  has been destroyed?  No.
Well, what if we move that to the fourth act? I have no idea what you're talking about, but that idea is terrible.
I hear the note.
Let me see what I can do.
And that's why this planet suuuuucks  So?  How can I put this? Imagine if the Holocaust happened every four years like the Olympics.
I would rather that happened than your rock opera.
That's not really a note.
In fact, none of your notes have been notes.
I feel like you're not even listening.
Yeah, well, you know what? Maybe I would listen if the Turbidians had some reason to enter the Cave of Swollen Dreams that didn't break the pact they made in act one  with Queen Darneesa.
 You have been listening.
This just doesn't make sense.
The Turbidians are a loyal people.
They they wouldn't betray their queen.
Unless They were working for Queen Darneesa, who gave them a potion that would counteract the effects of the Elixir of Failed Remembrance so they could bring the secret knowledge from the cave back to her, and then establish Newtopia as a vassal state to the Craterman kingdom! Well, don't just sit there! Get this down! Oh, you like that.
 You like daddy's good stuff?  Not especially.
Did you get there? Okay, what if there isn't a robot army? I think you just blew this thing wide open.
We'll make this our Newtopiaaa  # Up a fifth #  # Ah #  # Down a fifth #  # Aaah # That was great! This train is moving.
Let's take a break and get lunch.
 Wait, you want to get lunch with me?  Yeah, that's right.

 You're not a screwup anymore, Todd.
You're about to have a hit rock opera on your hands.
I'm really glad you think that.
I got Princess Carolyn to invite Virgil Van Cleef  to our next rehearsal.
 Who in the what Van? Virgil Van Cleef is the biggest name in rock opera.
Okay, think of all the great rock operas  from the last 20 years.
 Okay.
He had a piece of all of them.
Wow, Todd, are you sure we're ready for that? Hey, you said yourself the train is moving, but if you think we're not ready, I mean, I'll listen to you.
Hey, you've done enough listening, buddy.
Maybe it's about time I start listening.

I am very happy with my current  long distance provider, thank you.
 What? Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm having lunch with my friend.
But if you just listen All right, gang, when Virgil Van Cleef gets here, look alive.
This could be Todd's big break, so clap really hard and laugh at all the jokes, even if they're not funny, but also, be careful, because a lot of things you might think are jokes are not jokes, so, you know, look out.
 That was not a joke.
 That was not a real laugh.

Gentlemen, dazzle me.
What you're about to see is rough, very rough.
It's a vomit pass at what might become a rock opera.
Right now, it's set mostly in space, but we're not married to that.
Todd is neither a singer nor a trained musician.
In fact, he never even graduated high school, he told me in confidence.
Keep all that in mind as you give it up for Todd.
Okay, so we start in 1887 with a young Emma Goldman.
No they couldnnnn't make uuuus slaaaaaaves  It needs a third act showstopper.
 I had the same note.
But in all, it's spellbinding.
 All right!  Whoo! You know, I run a small theater in North Hollywood.

Yeah, Todd really rose to the occasion, didn't he?  I was talking about you.
 Ah, well, it was nothing.
Maybe the Zoe has a little Zelda in him after all.
I appreciate the sentiment, but I still think that game is stupid.
Hey, BoJack, do you realize what this means? I mean, if this thing's a hit, I could finally move out.
Oh, uh, you're gonna move out? You won't have to yell, Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!"" Or, ""Todd, why haven't you cleaned up your shit yet?"" Or, ""Todd, what was the name of that guy from Perfect Strangers? Not Bronson Pinchot, but the other one?"" Good, that's great.",Humor

Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready for the highflying world of rock opera or the larger world outside of my living room couch, but you know what? He's a good friend.
I don't see how that's relevant.
No, of course you don't.

You can live your happy Zelda life in this happy Zelda town and pretend you're a happy Zelda, but I know you, and this isn't you.

Mr.
Peanutbutter's a Zelda.
He's happy and he's carefree and he's loving, but you and me, we're Zoes.

Hey, yeah, Deedee came home! Gary, Marty, Artie, Deedee's back! Come here! Game.
Watching the game.
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing? Marty, it's a game from '86.
You've seen it a hundred times.
And how many times does Buckner break your heart? 100 times.
Aw, thank God you're here, Deedee.
Pops is wicked departed.
Oh, yeah, man.
He departed so hard.
And I do not like them apples, Deedee.
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.
Yeah, make that two, Deedee.
Gary, Marty, I just got home.
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't want to get her brother a beer.
Hey, Ma, come look what the Pats dragged in.
Oh, hello! Look who decided to come home.
Queen Deedee blesses us with her presence.
To what do I owe the honor? Look, I'm just here to offer my condolences.
Oh, sure, in and out, like a Protestant on Christmas.
Why would you want to stick around, be with your family in their time of need?  Come on, Ma.
 Don't fight while the game's on.
 It's bad Juju.
 It's the '86 World Series.
 They lose.
 Ah, why'd you have to Oh, we're just a bunch of savages, right? We're not like your fancy California friends.
Your George Clooney and your California Raisins.
Oh, come off it, Ma.
She don't mean no harm.
For five years she didn't come home.
Why don't you make like ARod and blow.
Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.
Ah, don't go.
Deedee, please.
Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.
Ma don't know what she wants.
She wants you here.
We all do.
Ain't that right, Marty? Can't look up from the game.
Besides, we need your help organizing all the funeral stuff.
We didn't go to college.
We're not smart like you.
Fine, I'll help.
Is there a number for me to call? Yeah, try Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.
And do it quick.

Welcome to the home of David Boreanaz, famous from television shows such as dramas on networks.
That will be $50 please.
Oy, mate, this picture of David Boreanaz fell apart.
Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle that.
Why don't you just go look through David Boreanaz's underwear drawer, okay?  It's in his bedroom.
 Oh, knickers.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Uhoh, am I reading something again? No, this is your conscience.
BoJack trusted you to take care of his house.
Is this really What are you doing? Dundundundun Dundundun It's a great day on Todd's phone.
How can I help you? Are you trying to cut me out of this David Boreanaz deal? I'm your agent, damn it.
How'd you find out about Boreanaz House? Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here batting a ball of yarn around while you do the real work.
I want to take your project to the next level.
We need to go bigger.
Have you thought about attaching Mila Kunis to this thing?  Attach her? How?  You do your job.
I'll do mine.
Who is this? Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.
Diaaaaane!  You show me nothing  What do you want from me? You have no right to barge in here after five years  and judge us, Diane.
 I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand instead of sitting on the couch watching the game all day.
 Ah, Deedee.
 You know very well his leg's still sore from the accident at the quarry.
Yeah, he's got to rest up if he's gonna be a wide receiver for B.
C.
He didn't get into B.
C.
Ah, what's the point of getting off the couch anyway? All the jobs are going to immigrants these days.
What do you We're immigrants.
 How do you figure?  We're Vietnamese? Step off! We're American as fuck.
And that's the same crap you always pull What do you want from me? Come on! Excuse me.
Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane.
Does anyone here speak English? Pull over and park the car.
Is that the frickin' horse from Horsin' Around? Again, does anyone here speak English?  Oh, no way  What? A TV star! Boreanaz house.
Seventyfive each.
Children and seniors free.
Please stay behind the ropes and keep your hands and belongings on your person at all times.

Oh, he eats grapes just like us? Hey, Ma, Ben Affleck eats grapes! He don't eat grapes! BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes.
He was graping it up with the Daredevil himself.
 This is the greatest day of my life.
 Oh! Hey, I don't suppose you boys would have any interest in maybe playing some touch football later? Are you kidding? Touch football with a star like you? That would be mad wicked pisser.
Ooh, you know what else we got to do? We got to watch the Cryane video.
Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that?  No, we don't need to revisit that.
 When Deedee was 16, we made up a secret pen pal for her named Leo.
Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.
We all took turns writing her letters, pretending to be this sensitive boy from Cambridge.
It was wicked messed up.
Oh, Diane, we're two misunderstood souls.",Humor
Everyone else is a phony.,Humor
"Yours forever, Leo.",Humor
"  What? That is amazing.
 After six months of letters, we hired a homeless guy to pretend to be Leo and take her to the homecoming dance.

 Watch, watch this part.
I like your boutonniÃÂ¨re.
Why don't we watch this every day?  Look at her face.
 Now that's a good prank.
 I was humiliated.
 Yeah, you wouldn't get it.
It's a brothers thing, right, brothers? Whoo! That's Cryane for you.
What a pussy.
You know, it's nice that years later we can all laugh about this.
Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing.
I'm gonna go meet with the funeral director.
Any of you boys want to come? Nah, I ain't so big on funeral homes, Deedee.
All them dead bodies, they give me the jeebies.
Yeah, Deedee, why do we got to go? Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.
 Come on, BoJack.
 Why you got to take BoJack with you?! Boo!  Boo!  Boys, you have stolen my heart like Dave Roberts stole second base.
Hey! He knows our things! I must go now, but I'll see you all at the funeral, okay? And when I do, you're all getting noogies.
 Funeral!  Yeah! Whoohoo! Funeral! Funeral! Funeral! And now, a very special treat just for our platinum members.
Let's take a peek at the slumbering Mr.
Boreanaz himself.
Get out of my room, Todd! I'm David Boreanaz.
Ohh! And thus concludes our tour.
Have a Boreanderful day.
Tell me about your father.
Well, he was a mean, sadistic alcoholic, who never supported anything I did and actively delighted in seeing me fail.
Hmm, I see.
Sounds like you're looking for our Piece of Shit Dad Package.
That would be too good for my father.
Hmm, I see.
Might I then suggest our Piece of Shit Dad Package Would Be Too Good For Him Package.
 Yeah, that's the one.
 Excellent choice.
Hey, can I suggest something? You might want to loosen up a little.
I think you could actually learn a thing or two  from your brothers.
 Are you kidding? If I was like my brothers, nothing would ever get done.
I'm just saying, if you can't find a way to let off some steam you're going to explode.
God damn it! Are you god damn kidding me? I keep getting calls from this unlisted number.
Ignore.
Who are these assholes? Why don't you just answer, and then you'll know? Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they? Ugh, how are we supposed to blackmail him if we can't reach him? Maybe we got to get him where he lives?  You mean ?  That's right, his house.
What the Whose house is this? Is that David Boreanaz? I could've sworn BoJack Horseman lived here.
Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh? You want to stop and chat, you gotta pay for the extended stay ticket.
Ah, so much, so much, so much.
Another five Gs, TBag, and we are in the pink.
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money, and the books aren't adding up.
Plus the men's lav needs to be serviced, and I had to fire Janine in the gift shop for stealing Boreabble heads.
I mean, how did I end up with all this responsibility? Hey, I'm not screwing around here, small fry.
 You better make those numbers sing.
 I don't think these offshore banks we've been using are 100% legal.
Yeah, well, my mother told me never to slap an idiot.
What? Ow! Now we're both breaking the rules.
You listen, and you listen good.
I've gotten used to a certain lifestyle since Boreanaz House went public, and I'm not going back to the old way.
Mommy likes her shoes, see? And her pearls.
Oh, I'm in too deep.
I don't know what to do.
I'll tell you what you should do.
Who said that? It's me, David Boreanaz.
Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like? Uh, sure.
Let me give you some advice.
As we say on my show I want to say, New Girl? just keep doing what you're doing, and you'll be fine.
Wow, thanks, Davie B.
Never call me that!  Unbelievable.
 It's 4:00.
I don't think anyone's coming.
Unbegoddamnlievable! All those jerk wads had to do was show up, and they couldn't even do that! Where's the body even? Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.
My goons went to pick your father up, but nobody was home.
For a nominal fee, we can scrounge up another body for you.
Would you care to peruse our loaner closet? Hey, assholes! Where were you? I planned the whole funeral, like you asked me to,  and nobody showed.
 Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't have wanted some stuffy funeral.
He would've wanted his body to be chopped up into chum  and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.
 Yeah, suck it, Jeter! Wait, what? Where is Dad? We got him chummed.
He's in the truck.
 You chummed Dad?  It's what your father wanted, honey, but then you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Let me get this straight.
So instead of coming to the funeral that I paid for and spent all day organizing, you had Dad's body ground into chum, so you could throw his mushy remains on Derek Jeter? No, not just on Derek Jeter.
We're gonna throw it into his fat face.
 Yeah, his fat face.
 In his fat face.
The Yankees are in town this week.
The planets are aligning, Deedee.
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.
Why does everything always got to be about bigshot Diane?  Too good for her home.
 I don't think I'm too good for my home.
Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.
Diane isn't a bigshot.
She's my ghostwriter.
She's writing a book that's not even gonna have her name on it.
You think this is how she expected her life would be going at 34? She lives with her rich boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.
She's not too good for anything.
 What?  Diane's a freeloader?  Even I pay rent.
 BoJack helping? Whoa.
This is why I told you to wait in the car! Oh, she snapped.
Here comes Cryane.
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.
Diane, you are making a public spectacle of yourself.
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.
Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.
Dad's chum is in the back.
No! No, no, no! Suck a dick, dumb shits! Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took Pops.
Oh, no, what are we gonna do? And it's a onehopper back to the pitcher.
Easy out at first.
So what we're gonna do is nothing? Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.
Does anyone know where she might have gone? Ah, she used to run off like this all the time in high school, too.
Who knows where crazy goes? I think I know where she went.
Wait, you can't leave.
The party's just getting started.
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset,  and she's got your dad.
 Oh, don't go, BoJack.
You're like the fifth brother I never had.
 I Really?  Yeah, don't leave, bro.
After this, we'll go play touch football and do a noogie parade.
Ah, um Everyone please disperse.
This is an unlawful gathering.
Disperse immediately.
Oh, this isn't looking good, Princess Carolyn.
 What are we gonna do?  What do you mean, we? Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.
Ha! Mr.
Boreanaz, I presume.
Um, would you like a Boreabble head? The amazing thing is, the house looks just like BoJack's house.
They must have the same architect.
Anyway, how are things with you? Not good.
I should've known it was a waste of time to come back here.
Oh, that's awful.
Well, when you get back, I'll give you one of my patented Peanutbutter hugs.
Crunchy and creamy.
You know that patent wasn't approved, but I'll take it.
 I have to go.
BoJack's here.
 BoJack, well, what's he doing ? Hey.

It's all true, isn't it? I found this letter back at the bar.
I think it's for you.
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.

" That's the best letter he ever wrote me.
Look, take it from someone with his own shitty parents, family is a sinkhole, and you were right to get out when you had the chance.
The stupid thing is, even now I still just want them to be proud of me and think I did good.
Is that really stupid?  Yep.
 No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
You want those guys to be proud of you? I guess I was just hoping to get some modicum of closure.
Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn't exist in the real world.
The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.
Yeah, but every time I come back here they So don't come back here.
What's great about Los Angeles is nobody cares about where you're from or who you are.
It's a superficial town where you can worry about stupid shit like keeping your pool clean, and what artisanal nuts to put on your salad.

 Why do you think people keep moving there?  Thanks, BoJack.
The good news is, your dad can't hurt anyone ever again.
Uhoh.
Gonna spend the day Over at Fenway Thank you so much, Derek Jeter.
I thought a big baseball hotshot like you would be too busy to help us old ladies across the street.
I always have time to look out for my elders, Yankee fan or no.
Is that a barrel of chum? Only at Fenway Badum, badadum Um, I'll meet you inside.
I have to make a call.
Okay.
It's Herb.
You know what to do.
Hey, Herb, look, I think we have some unfinished business.
It seems like life's too short to hold grudges and stuff like that, you know what I'm saying? About life being too short? Well, of course you know what I'm saying.
You're the one with terminal I feel like I'm doing all the talking here.
So anyway, I thought maybe we could chat.
Why don't you give me a call, okay? Um so smell you later? This is BoJack.
Horseman.
Obviously.
Ugh, who keeps calling me? Come on, BoJack.
Pick up, pick up.
I'm sure he'll pick up.
It's BoJack.
You know what to do.
Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  # I'm BoJack the horse #  # BoJack # BoJack the horse Don't act like you don't know And I'm trying to hold on to my past It's been so long I don't think I'm gonna last I guess I'll just try And make you understand That I'm more horse than a man Or I'm more man than a horse BoJack Boxer versus raptor.
Na na na na na na na na 

 Huh?  Oh, uh, it's a pet name.
I don't have actual honey.
Diane! Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Mwah.
BoJack Horseman!  Put her there!  That's all right.
I'm gonna get that handshake.
No, you're not.
Since when am I Honey? Since now.
I made up the nickname while you were back east.
Yeah, really? You made up calling someone honey? Uh, I do believe so.
Yes.
Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride? That's okay.
Todd's supposed to pick me up.
Where is he? First day, huh? Well, stick with me.
You're gonna be just fi Probably just forgot, the lazy bum.
Hey, I'll take the ride as long as it's not as bumpy as that pilot's landing.
That was seriously very scary.
 Hey  I'm just glad you were there, because I really would have freaked out by myself.
Be stiller, my beating heart.
Stiller crazy after all these years.
Did I miss something funny?  I love funny somethings.
 No, we were just laughing about this Ben Stiller article from the plane.
Ooh, he is the best.
 What did it say?  You wouldn't get it.
Either you read Hemisphere's Magazine, or you don't.
Hey, I might be crazy, because this is such a dumb question, and I'm embarrassed to even ask, but do I have anything to worry about with you and Diane? What? What? Get out of here.
I got to say, BoJack, that is a relief.
Hoho! Whoo! Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner? Or at least some road sodas, so I don't have to go through the ordeal of sobering up and then having to get drunk all over again? Oh, I actually already made special plans for just the two of us.
Oh, come on.
You're the one who's always saying you want to hang out with BoJack more, and how it's weird that BoJack never returns your calls, and how I should hang up the phone because maybe BoJack's trying to call you right now.
Uh, okay.
I guess we can make this work.
Oh.
Oh, man.
Remember that guy in 34B? Do I? Can't stop remembering him.
Uh, hey.
Diane and I have memories, too.
This place reminds me of a cliff side meal we had one romantic vacay to Cabo.
Boring.
I wasn't there.
Can we keep this general interests? Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.
Mmm.
Oh, oh.
Ew.
There's something in my food.
Ah, crap.
Someone get the manager.
No, no, no.
Wait.
It's supposed to be in there.
Welcome home, honey.
I got you a D pendant, because I am Dpendant on you.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
Real Real cute.
 A D for dog.
 It's for Diane.
This is the sweetest choking hazard anyone's ever given me.
Mwah.
Well, how about some champagne for the happy couple.
Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.
You're too kind, but everyone knows you go off menu for the good stuff.
Yes, get me your most expensive bottle from the back.
Perhaps a 1922ISH Heidsieck Diamant Bleu? A toast on me to Diane and Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I'd like a round of drinks for everyone.
Off the menu, of course.
BoJack, folks.
What a sport.
And while we're all in giving moods, I'd like to buy you all an Xbox, courtesy of me.
Wow.
You guys don't have to do this.
Look, I could happily go down this petty road of raising and reraising one another.
Please do! But I'd instead like to highlight the fact that Mr.
Peanutbutter's ripping off my toast the same way he ripped off my entire career.
Uh, we prefer gifts over observations.
Okay.
Well, here's something I didn't rip off.
This brand new helicopter I just bought.
Whoowhoo! Who wants a ride in the chopper? Okay, guys.
This has been fun, and also an offensive display of extravagant wealth, but maybe we should call it a night.
What's the rush? Because I just bought the restaurant, and we can stay as long as we want.
Hey, you.
I own you now.
Do a dance.
Oops.
Oh, no.
Hey, sorry, bud.
 It's all yours.
 Please, you first.
Apparently, we both like to be clean.
I love being clean.
That's so coincidental.
 I'm Todd.
 Klaus.
Look, I know you're new here, being white, into cleansing.

Oh, come on.
I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure.
Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah.
Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably.
Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions.
Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure, of course, but do I like her? The answer's no.
You have nothing to worry about.
I'll cut you a deal.
I help you get rid of that D, and you never talk to Diane again.
Well, I have to talk to her, because she's writing my book.
Okay, but just don't pursue her romantically?  Deal.
 Ha!  I knew I'd get that handshake.
 I regret this already.
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.
Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.
Did we just say that  Oh!  At the same time? Look, I saw you talking to Klaus in the shower.
Now, the Aryan's are good guys.
Don't get me wrong.
But I don't know if you're gonna get the right attention over there.
Uh, I'd hate to get lost in a shop that big.
Now we can't offer you the works, but in the Latin Kings, you'll be a star.
We're number two, and that means we try harder.
Am I really being courted by two gangs? Oh, I feel like the belle of the ball.
So, this is the shapeless biographer I've heard so much about.
We've met several times.
Did you just call me here to insult me? What is your secret, lady? I mean, how do you get two grown men fighting over you like a foul ball at a football game? First of all, football doesn't have foul balls.
Ugh, sports.
Second of all, nobody's fighting over me.
Open your eyes.
BoJack's clearly in love with you.
Wha? Get out of here! Get out of here? Why would I get out of here? You get out of here.
This is my office.
I get the army men are police, but what's the mustard packet again? Oh, that's just a mustard packet.
 It's left over from lunch.
 Oh.
Well, can we move it off the table? No.
I still might want it later.
Good call.
So how do we get the D from here all the way up to here? What, with all these cops and mustards,  it's gonna be a pickle.
 Oh, no.
The pickle's a SWAT van, but I see your point.
Might be easier to just ditch the evidence.
But how? I I don't know.
You think these coffees would get the juices flowing.
Well, they do have Bailey's in them.
Is that why I feel drunk? Because I've had, like, seven or eight coffees.
I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas, but it's been great for camaraderie.
Couldn't agree more.
Ooh, hey.
What time is it? I probably need to move my helicopter.
It's in a twohour zone.
You beautiful bastard, that's it! We can pick up the D with your chopper, fly it out of here, and then dump it out into the ocean.
Stupendous! Take that, the ocean.
 What now, Todd?  Listen.
So, kind of landed myself in a twodatestotheprom situation.
The dates being prison gangs and the prom being a jumpin, so do you remember how you got out of the same jam on Horsin' Around? Ah, a classic conundrum.
Well, I recall one time on Mr.
Peanutbutter's House I think he's talking to me, pal.
You know, the guy whose show invented the twodatestotheprom story.
You may have invented it, but I think our show perfected it.
The only thing you ever perfected  was stealing my thunder.
 Stealing your thunder, eh? Now you're even stealing the words I'm saying.
You know, it's tough.
I agree with the Latin Kings on social issues, but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.
Well, juggling both never ends well.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, anything to contribute? He's just staring blankly now.
Stealing your thunder.
You could also just bail me out of here, as I said.
 It's only 50 bucks  Got to go, pal.
Hope it's a magical night.
All right, you ready for the plan? Oh, yeah.
But we are gonna need a big distraction to keep the eyes off the skies.
You leave that to me.
Whoa, wait.
You had a lot to drink.
You better have a cup of coffee.
Who loves you, people? Look this way, news media.
A celebrity is throwing away his hardearned cash.
Everyone pay attention to me.
Oh, it's only onedollar bills, folks.
Don't bother.
No, it's still free, spendable money.
This is a huge story.
Dollars are like the new penny.
Yeah.
Cash is for poor people.
What is wrong with you bozos? Just riot over the damn money already.
Well, nothing to see here, I guess.
Ooh, ooh Whoa! Jesus Christ, my ankle Oh, my God.
American singersongwriter BeyoncÃ© is hurt.
Somebody help her! Ring the alarm.
Irreplaceable pop icon and independent woman BeyoncÃ© has been injured.
What more can you give us? Details are sketchy at this point, but we do know BeyoncÃ© is a survivor, and presumably she will keep on surviving.
 But what happened?  Well, Tom, I'm being told she fell on all the single dollars.
 All the single dollars?  All the single dollars.
All the single dollars?  All the single dollars.
 Bills, bills, bills.
We promise to provide live, unflinching coverage of this harrowing ordeal of a star gone from dangerously in love to dangerously in peril.
Don't stop watching.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, take her home.
Doctors have confirmed that BeyoncÃ© will never perform again.
This just in.
A break in the story of the Hollywoo heist.
We now go live to the house of Mr.
Peanutbutter, star of Mr.
Peanutbutter's House.
Ah, jeez.
What did that idiot do? Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I, and I alone, stole the D from the Hollywoo sign.
Just tell us, why'd you do it? Oh, I'll tell you why.
I did it all for my girlfriend, Diane.
Aww.
Son of a bitch.
That literal son of a bitch.
If you're joining us, Mr.
Peanutbutter has confessed to stealing the D for his girlfriend Diane in what many are calling the most romantic gesture in the history of romance and gestures.
We now await the L.
A.
P.
D.
's move.
The day they make love a crime is the day I turn in my badge.
And here's our lady of the hour now, Diane.
Diane! What do you think? Wow, Mr.
Peanutbutter, uh, it's kind of a lot.
I don't really like to be on camera.
And? Do you love anything or anyone? I got to go.
We'll talk about it later.
Ooh Oh, my Todd.
You look You look beautiful, holmes.
What? This old thing? The guards made me wear it.
Yeah, well, it suits you.
You're an autumn, bro.
Ahh.
It's good, right? Oh.
Come meet my boy, Santiago.
Uh, you know, I'll I'll be right back.
I I left my cot unmade.
Ooh, watch it.
Oh, sorry I'm late.
Hope you didn't think I was pulling an Anne Frank on you.
Good one.
Can you believe it? I was doublecrossed by the one man I assumed was too stupid to even singlecross.
What? I have no idea what you're talking about.
I do have a life outside of you, you know.
Mr.
Peanutbutter took my D and gave it to Diane.
Once again, he completely ripped me off.
Oh, right.
That whole thing.
Just a minute, Cate.
Look, you may have come up with a log line, but he's the one who sold the pitch.
This is more on brand for him than it is for you.
 What do you mean?  Desecrated a major landmark in a drunken stupor, that's a BoJack Horseman thing.
But stealing it for your girlfriend as a grand display of affection? That's Mr.
Peanutbutter.
You're right.
It's Mr.
Peanutbutter all over.
It's the kind of bold, romantic gesture they base movies on.
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Lora? Check if anyone's bought the rights yet.
Can we keep this about me, please? Even if he stole your stealing of the D, what he made his was telling Diane how he felt from his heart.
You could never say it to me, and you still can't say it to her.
That's not true.
I can express feelings.
Nothing on the outside.
Nothing on the inside.
Look, I got to bounce.
Quick question, though.
Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun? Why are you wasting my time with this?  Of course I would.
Who wouldn't?  Huh.
And that's why Eva Braun was like the fifth Beatle of the Third Reich.
Wow.
I never knew neoNazis were so interested in Nazis.
You got some great moves, Todd.
You dance like a white man, and I love it.
Hey, no disrespect, but I got a few chess pieces I forgot need whittling.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, thank God you're back.
I was getting nervous that you left me for another gang.
If that happened, I'd have to kill you.
Thank you for rescheduling given your recent, uh, everything.
Yeah.
That was really something.
I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller? Yeah, but for some reason the jury's Stiller out on how I feel about it.
Well, that's because it wasn't for you.
That wasn't a Diane thing.
It was a Mr.
Peanutbutter thing.
Well, what would be a Diane thing? A Diane thing would be something that shows he really knows you, like giving you an iPod loaded with all your favorite podcasts, or a practical houseplant, or surprising you with a bound album of photos and emails he saved.
That's That's what the Diane I know would want.
What are you saying to me? Just that you should be with someone who knows you.
Yeah? Like who? I Whoa, were we Were we taping? Um, okay.
Uh, you want to hear my Andy Dick story? It's a doozie.
All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered.
Drugs, cigarettes.
I mean, that's the standard gang rate.
Hey, I got to go, uh, do a prison thing.
That sounds legitimate.
We are in prison, after all.
Whew.
Hey.
White people, right? Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan are you dressed like a Latin King?  Uh, what  What the hell, bro?  Are you playing both sides?  Look, guys, I didn't want to choose between you because I like you both.
Look, in fact, if you just took the time to get to know each other the way you did me, I think you'd agree we don't need gangs anymore because, deep down, we're all just people.
What do you say? This just in.
A standoff at the Super Max has turned into a fullon race war.
But first, America has fallen in love with Hollywoo itcouple, Mr.
Peanutbutter and Diane Diane? Is that you? Hey.
It's, um, me.
Look, uh, things got a bit weird earlier, so I I want to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow to talk about the time I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.
I'm really sorry about before.
I know the D was overkill, so I got you something more personal.
Aww.
I also wanted to just, um, let you know how much I appreciate you working on this book with me.
I know I sometimes get carried away, but it's because I love you so much.
You're a catch, Diane, and I think you know how much I love catch.
And I'm sorry if I've been difficult in any way during this process.
You know, it's It's really hard to have somebody, I don't know, know you, I guess.
And you do, uh, know me, Diane.
We're very different, but I think we bring out the best in each other.
It's like you're chocolate and I'm  Peanutbutter?  What? Now see? That was so much better than what I was gonna say.
I was gonna say carrots.
And I know I'm not the perfect guy.
I actually kind of hate myself a lot of the time.
But when When I'm with you, I, uh, don't hate myself.
I like being around you, and I don't know if I ever told you that in so many words, so I'm telling you.
Diane, I've got an important question to ask.
No cameras, no big spectacle.
Just me and you.
Call me back.
This was BoJack, by the way.
Horseman, obviously.
Will you do the honor Of becoming Mrs.
Peanutbutter? Wow.
This is happening so fast.
Yes.
I'll marry you.
But I'm keeping my last name.
You hear that? She said yes! Let's kick it! Erica, did you hear she said yes? Come on in here! All right! She's not gonna call.
Get out the consolation scotch.
It's her! Make that celebration scotch.
 What's the difference?  It's the same scotch! Diane! Hey, you! Hey.
So this is weird.
I'm engaged.
Oh, wow.
To Mr.
Peanutbutter? I saw you left me a voicemail Delete it.
It's just a drunken recipe for Bundt cake.
Not important.
Okay.
I got to go.
They're about to move the D back.
 See you tomorrow?  Absolutely.
Well, nobody knows me like you.
Time to bring this baby home.
To think I went from flying missions over Kandahar to this cushy crap.
I spoke too soon! Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down! See, you guys aren't so different.
We're free! We're free!  Yeah!  Freedom!  I am free!  Freedom! Oh, wow.
What a twist, huh? And they say there's no new stories in Hollywoo.
Hollywoo, Hollywoo Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  I'm BoJack the horse  BoJack BoJack the horse Don't act like you don't know And I'm trying to hold on to my past It's been so long I don't think I'm gonna last I guess I'll just try And make you understand That I'm more horse than a man Or I'm more man than a horse BoJack Boxer versus raptor.
Nananananananana! 

You got to get your shit together.
So you took some licks, but you're gonna bounce back, because you're talented, you're smart, and damn it, you're good.
You are a goddamn American treasure, you know that? You are BoJack goddamn Horseman.
So get the hell off my lawn.
Oh.
Here I thought I was at the drivethrough at Carl's Jr.
How much did I have to drink last night? Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender for the last two weeks, ever since you found out Diane got engaged to Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Diane got engaged to Mr.
Peanutbutter?  I need a drink.
 No.
No more drinking.
You've been out of control.
Princess Carolyn, look.
I met John Stamos.
That is not John Stamos.
Hey, Princess Carolyn, John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.
That is not your ear.
Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died.
Why? Why, God? Why did you take John Stamos? That doesn't sound so bad.
Oh, I forgot to mention you were naked for a lot of that.
Stamos! Also, it wasn't here.
It was at my office.
We thought night swimming would be fun, but the current was too strong.
Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I? No.
You made Todd your designated driver, but then you also made him drink with you.
Yeah, I'll have a western bacon cheeseburger.
BoJack, we are going to get you back on your feet.
All you need to do is get off Diane and get on to something else.
Hello? Tony, hi.
I'm calling in that favor.
Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house.
Can you be there in an hour?  Yeah.
 Great.
What just happened? You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.
What is Guten Bourbon? It's an urban German bourbon.
Am I just hungover, or are you talking like a Muppet? They're looking for American celebrities to talk about how much they like to drink.
It's the part you were born to play.
All you have to do is smile and stay upright.
I don't know.
It sounds like a lot of work.
You take up 80% of my time with your drama and make me 0% of my money.
Do the damn commercial.
Okay, I got to go.
You're in charge, Todd.
Keep this dummy out of trouble.
Hooray, responsibility.
Hey.
Do you really believe all that stuff you said to me earlier about me being smart and talented and good? BoJack, I'm an agent.
I believe everything I say.
Ah.
Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger? I ordered it, like, an hour ago.
Lenny Turteltaub, you skinny bitch.
How the hell are you? I'm in a hurry, so I'll make this snappy.
I got some great news about the picture we're putting together.
Sorry.
Hello? Hey, I just wanted to thank you for getting me this job and pulling me out of that ohsopredictably BoJack spiral of selfloathing and substance abuse.
 You really are the best.
 I know.
Talk to you later.
I feel like you see things in me that nobody else sees.
Yep, I'm pretty great.
Got to go.
All this time, I never even BoJack, I'm in a very important breakfast right now.
 Okay.
I got to go, too.
 Sorry.
What's the great news?  We got Braff.
 You beautiful dickhead.
You finally got Zach Braff? Ah, no other director has enough weight to handle a movie about the last days of Eva Braun.
No shit, toots.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
There you go.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Everything's coming together.
With Braff directing, my client Cate Blanchett starring, and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing, this movie is a done deal.
Look, honey, I been in this business a long time, okay? Long time.
And as I once said to a young Ed Begley Sr.
, It ain't a done deal till the deals are all done.",Humor
" I'm the best agent in the biz.
I can seal these deals with my paws in my pants.
Well, then I'll say to you what I once said to a young Buster Keaton, What?"" Laura! What's happening?  We're merging.",Humor

That was an important phone call.
Important phone call beep boop blorp.
Don't you robotvoice me.
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing? Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.
Before I go, I got you a little sexy something to remember me by.
Since we can't be together every second, which would be my preference, I give you cardboard BoJack.
It's got a lightsensitive sound chip, so every time you walk by it, it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire, your favorite movie.
You complete me.
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh? You had me at hello.",Humor
" I don't have time for you or cardboard you.
I need to find a new director.
Or you could find my nude erector She's gone.
Blech.
Word to the wise, Laura Do not pitch a Nazi romance to Steven Spielberg.
Just thought you should know there's been some reorganization  visavis resource management.
 What are you saying? You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office until they can find her a permanent one.
 The hell we are.
 Also Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.
What? You said you couldn't be my girlfriend and my agent, so I'm firing you.
Now we can be in love.
 Hope you like money, BoJack.
 This is so great.
Now I can date you and have a better agent.
 Everybody wins.
 Oh.
I'm a sporting agent.
Are you still searching for happiness? Make your own happiness.
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.
Cut.
That was great.
Was it? You know, I'm trying to do good work here, really find the character, but it's pretty distracting to have all these robots staring at me with their blinking red eyes.
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.
Oh, well, you want to make a good one? Then get them the hell out of here! I'm the face of this brand, I'm the man behind the thing, and I'm determined to get the jargon of this German bourbon blurbin'.
Is it just me, or does this fake booze taste a lot like real booze? You want BoJack, you can have him.
Here's a list of directors who won't work with him, studios that won't hire him, former assistants with restraining orders.
This is great.
You know, it gets kind of boring when all your clients are in such demand, they practically find their own jobs.
Well, then BoJack should be a lot of fun for you.
No one wants to hire him.
Hello.
We're looking for BoJack Horseman's agent.
We'd like to discuss a very lucrative business opportunity.
 You gotta be kidding me.
 I'm BoJack's agent.
The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.
Ha.
All yours.
Needless to say, it would be a shame if these pictures got out.
Fortunately, that can easily be avoided by simply paying me and my partner here $150.
Each.
Let me just get my checkbook.
Huh? Whoa.
Oh, except California law prohibits taking photos on private property without a permit, but you had a permit, right?  Uh  What's that? Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted as a class E felony.
That's four years in prison, easy, and when you throw in the murder of Tupac Shakur  We didn't do that.
 Yeah, yeah.
You can't pin that on us.
Well, someone's got to take the fall.
Sorry to bother you.
Forget we were ever here.
That was fun.
Hey, Laura, send those guys a nice fruitandnut basket.
You got it, boss.
Who said you could use my assistant?  I did.
 Oh, hello, Mr.
Witherspoon.
Did you know the human head weighs 8 pounds? Fascinating.
So sorry we have to double up on everything while we work out who goes where and who gets fired, but in the meantime, help yourself to an intern, one of the rising stars at our company  Charlie Witherspoon.
 Hello.
I Oh.
Sorry, my My hands are really sticky.
Oh, God, am I blowing this? Charlie was the editor of The Harvard Lampoon.
He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant while I use Laura.
 Ugh.
 Good thinking, boss.
Ah, ah, phone is ringing.
Phone is ringing.
What do I do? What do I do? I'll take it in here, Charlie.
Hello.
Princess Carolyn, your client is out of control.
BoJack is not my client anymore.
Not BoJack.
Todd.
I think someone mixed alcohol into his prop drink.
Oh, you pretenders.
Bourbon is the name of a county.
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.
That would be like making RiceARoni  anywhere but San Francisco.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Ugh.
I'll be right there.
 Ow.
You got to get your shit together.
You are a winner, okay? You are Todd Hold on.
Fish.
Okay, you are Todd goddamn  What's your last name?  Chavez.
 Your last name is Chavez?  Yeah.
Why? I don't know, I just never thought of you as a Chavez.
Look, I got to go.
I feel like you didn't really finish the pep talk.
I know, but I got a movie to put together.
Best of luck.
Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.
What the heck is going on? The woman who loved the man who hated everyone.",Humor
"  That writes itself.
 You got to be kidding me.
Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.
You're having the Eva Braun meeting without me? I'm so sorry, but I didn't know what the protocol was around here, and these guys were just champing at the bit.
 We're just wrapping up.
 But Cate is my client.
Okay, why don't I come find you when it's over, and I'll bring you up to speed? Is that Quentin Tarantulino? Yeah.
I brought him on board.
You know he's always wanted to direct a romantic comedy? Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.
Bye.
We live in a cynical world, a cynical world.
He's right, you know.
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, overrotate.
Hey.
I just missed an important meeting because I was babysitting Todd, who's too drunk to work, because you switched out the prop bourbon with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.
 Have dinner with me tonight.
 No way.
Come on, just me, you, and a bottle of Pinot.
Probably more than one bottle and some entrees.
And I'll probably get an appetizer.
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.
 I have to work.
 You don't have to work.
 You choose to work.
 Hmm.
Why not choose to be happy for once? Mm.
When you're writing a memoir, you spend a lot of time reflecting on the past.
I regret not being a better friend to you and lover.
Thank you.
Lover's kind of a weird word, but thanks.
You want to get out of this stuffy old restaurant, get some gelato, and maybe drive out to the ocean  and put our feet in the water?  That sounds great.
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.
Great.
I'll get the car and meet you outside.
You scamper right back, pussycat.
You look at your reflection too long, you might fall in love.
She's gone.
What do you want, Gekko? Well, I was hoping to talk to you facetoface, but I guess you had to leave work early.
I left at 8:30.
What is it? Well, Cate and I had a really good talk today.
We have so much in common, and especially since I'm doing so much for Eva Braun, it almost seemed weird that I wasn't repping her.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
She and I are both highpowered working mothers, so I understand her priorities, so she's switching to Gekko.
Wow, being a mom helped my career? I really can have it all.
This isn't fair.
I know everything about Cate.
Her favorite color is red.
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.
I know all I need to know, which is that she's beautiful, she's British, and she's gonna make me a lot of money.
She's Australian, you moron.
If you need me, I'll be at work.
Bye.
Bye.
Ugh.
Uh, telephone.
Charlie, get me Cate Blanchett.
Um, who is Okay, I don't Uh, uh, sorry, I can't Oh, sticky.
You know what? Never mind.
If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate that bad, she can have her.
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be happy.
Tonight, I choose to be happy.
Hello? I think I put you on mute.
Good night, Charlie.
Holy shit.
Herb! How the hell are you, buddy? Ruin any lives lately?  Excuse me?  I got your message, asshole.
You got something to say to me, you come out to Malibu and say it to my face.
I'll be alive tomorrow.
After that, who knows? Sorry that took me so long.
Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.
Hey, um, I just got kind of a weird phone call.
You and me both.
Hey, screw 'em all, right? Yeah.
Are we going to gelato? Princess Carolyn, what are we doing? Getting gelato? This was a mistake.
I've been acting crazy.
That phone call just pulled me back to reality.
You were right.
I don't love you.
You don't love me.
We're just two lonely people trying to hate ourselves a little less.
Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.
Maybe that's all we ever were.
Well, this night took a turn.
You know the worst part? I knew this was gonna happen and I let myself get excited anyway.
So we agree that this is on you, then? I guess I'll see you around.
You're not even gonna give me a ride home? Sorry, I think I just need to be alone right now.
Of course, of course.
That's what you get when you fall for a horse.
Taxi.
You got to get your shit together.
So yesterday, you let yourself fall in love a little bit, and you got your heart broken.
Serves you right for having feelings.
Starting now, you are a hard, heartless career gal.
Go to work, be awesome at it, and don't waste time on foolish flights of fancy.
From now on, you are a robot.
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.
 Hello.
 I just want you to know I'm fine.
Uhoh.
People only say they're fine when they're not fine.
Did I hurt your feelings last night? I'm an agent.
I don't have feelings.
Well, I'm glad you called.
I think that you had the right idea yesterday.
I should be getting back to work.
Can you get me another job? Yeah, well, I'm not your agent anymore, so, no.
Oh, right.
Well, just tell whoever, then.
Haah! Whoa.
Asshole! Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.
He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing.
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.
Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb? You must be really Nope, don't care.
Not interested.
Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie, because that's all we're gonna do today.
My tie got stuck in the copier this morning.
That's great, Charlie.
If you flip them real quick, it looks like the tie is running.
Hey, Vanessa, your client, BoJack Horseman, wants a job.
 Good luck.
 Oh, yeah, about that.
Gwyneth came in this morning, and I wanted to show her that she was a top priority, so I shredded BoJack's contract right in front of her.
Heh heh What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.
I say good riddance to Mr.
Houseman or whatever that horse's name is.
It's not like he makes this company any money, and he does seem to take up an awful lot of your time.
I'm from Arizona, Jerry.
I went to Arizona State.
Todd, how do I turn this thing off? Todd.
What? I'm busy.
Never mind.
Think I've figured it out.
Now that I've got the room to myself, time to practice the trombone.
He's kind of in a bad place right now.
You can't just drop him.
The best agent in this building couldn't get that guy a job.
The best agent in this building got him a job yesterday, and I could get him a feature by the end of today.
If you want to get him a movie by the end of the day, great, do that.
Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him.
Charlie, I hear NBC picked up your running tie show.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Dad.
Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here.
How'd you like to work with the BoJack Horseman? What's that? You hate his guts? What's that? He's a talentless boob? What's that? You'll never work with BoJack again? What's that? You want him to die in an ass factory warehouse fire, smothering to death under a pile of burning asses? Well, if you change your mind, give me a call.
Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you? I don't understand why you're going through all this trouble for him.
That guy's dead weight, Princess Carolyn.
If you don't cut him loose, you're never gonna be happy.
Help me help you.
That's it.
Of course.
Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch.
You know Jerry Maguire's my favorite movie of all time? All your films are so human, which is super impressive since you're a crow.
Well, my name is Cameron Crow, but I'm actually a raven, so common misconception.
 Well, whatever you are  A raven.
 I brought you this  Suffragette City a coming of age story about rock music, being a teenager in the '80s and buying zoos""? How have I not heard of this book? You'd be the perfect director to make a movie out of it, and I happen to know this is Cate Blanchett's favorite book.",Humor

"Eva Braun is your dream, remember? Cate? Hello? Cate! Oh, no.",Humor
"What happened? Did Cate drop out of your little Holocaust movie so she could make my little Cameron Crow movie? Why don't you go home and cry about it to your loving husband and children? Say, which one of you is overseeing the Eva Braun package? That would be me, sir.",Humor
"Vanessa, you really shat the bed on this one.",Humor
"Now, are you fired?  Not exactly.",Humor
Can you still work here?  No.,Humor
Lenny Turteltaub here to see you.,Humor

"Next, I hear she's doing a picture with Cameron Crow about mix tapes.",Humor
"As I said to Ed Porter at the premiere of The Great Train Robbery, ""Aah, the train's coming right at me.",Humor

Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.
All that work for nothing.
Now Quentin Tarantulino's got four arms up my ass 'cause he got all excited about making a romcom.
You know what would be a great romantic comedy? Remember when that guy stole the D from the Hollywood sign so he could propose to his girlfriend? That would make a great movie, but who would play the lead? Preferably someone kind of washed up.
You know how much Quentin loves to revitalize dead careers.
It's kind of his thing.
Well, in that case, you know who'd be great? Show me the money.
 Yeah.
 Good news.
You're back in my stable, and I got you the lead in a romantic comedy.
Who's the best agent in the world? What? I went through hell and back today, but it was worth it because I got you a job.
Aren't you excited? No.
I don't know.
I don't care about that.
You You said you wanted a job.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
 Wow.
What happened in Malibu?  I got to go.
Need anything else? No, thanks, Laura.

You're gonna be a big success.
Herb says that to me all the time.

 He does? Yeah, I'm not worried about if you'll become a star.
I'm more worried about how you'll change when it happens.

BJ, can you believe it? We're gonna make an actual TV show! One that takes an unflinching look at the gritty reality of the American family.
Just kidding.
Let's get rich! [both] Yeah.
[rock music] Generic '90s grunge song Everyone in flannel Generic '90s grunge song Something from Seattle Why would I say, You'll never get me in that sweater"" in this scene and then, in the very next scene, I'm wearing the sweater? Did my character suddenly forget that he didn't want to wear the sweater? No, see, that's actually the joke.",Humor
Don't explain the joke to me.,Humor
I just don't understand how it's a joke.,Humor
So you do want me to explain it to you? I want you to add a scene showing how I changed my mind about the sweater so the goddamn episode makes sense.,Humor
"Look at me, doing your job for you.",Humor
"Way to go, Shakespeare.",Humor
"BJ, you're doing the scene as written.",Humor
What happened to the stories I requested? Where's my rap? You said you'd write me a rap.,Humor
We're working on it.,Humor
"We just need a rhyme for ""and I'm here to say.",Humor
" Well, what about giving me Rollerblades? How are people gonna know that my character is hip if he doesn't roll the blade? Just get out there and do your job.
Every one of your ideas is stupid or racist.
That was one pitch, and I didn't say they're all thieves.
But if you're too scared to start a national dialogue, maybe I'll take my ideas home.
Good luck making Horsin' Around without the horse.
BoJack, hon.
That audience out there traveled from all over the country just to taste some of your magic.
Do you really want to disappoint them? [sighs] Okay, Sharona.
I'll go out and jerk this limp script until it gets hard, but I'm not doing it for Herb.
I'm doing it for the fans.
And your 30K an episode.
[announcer] Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman! And there better be some Zimas in my dressing room after the show.
[cheers and applause] Wait a minute.
This isn't the bar.
I got to fire my assistant.
[laughter] You guys sound like you're ready for a show.
[rock music] Oh, gross.
Why do I keep trying to like Zima? [phone rings]  Talk to me, world.
 BoJack, it's Princess Carolyn.
How are you doing today? Well, I'll tell you my problem.
 I just keep getting handsomer.
 [laughs] Good problems to have.
Hold for a sec.
I've got your agent on the line.
[Marv] BoJack Goddamn Horseface.
I got some news so good, you'll goddamn kiss me.
Put it here.
Put it here.
What's the role you've been dying to play your whole life, besides Kathy Ireland's bathing suit? Haha.
She is attractive.
Good God, when I die, bury me in Kathy Ireland.
Uh, Marv? Marv? What's the big news? Secretariat! It's happening, and it's down to you and Val Kilmer for the title role.
That's amazing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, listen.
I don't want to see you in any more tabloids.
Keep your head down and your nose clean.
Now, I gotta go.
I got a lunch with MC Skat Kat.
[man on TV] Scandal breaking today surrounding the family sitcom, Horsin' Around.
Oh, God.
What did I do this time? Herb Kazzaz, the show's creator, was caught tonight in an LAPD sting  on public indecency.
 Wha Police say Mr.
Kazzaz was caught in the middle of lewd acts with another man.
Conservative groups have been quick to organize.
Horsin' Around is a show for kids.
My family should be able to watch those nubile preteens without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting their alternative lifestyles and ruining America.
Sheeeiiiiit.
BoJack, I gotta tell ya.
 I'm gay.
 No doy.
I know we haven't been close for the past couple years.
Okay, I'm gonna hold back my No doys"" because there might be a lot.",Humor
"But you know me, right? You know that I'm a good guy.",Humor
"They're gunning for me at the network, and if I get kicked off this, I won't recover.",Humor
I need to know that you've got my back.,Humor
"If you threaten to walk, they'll listen to you.",Humor
"Herb, you picked the worst possible time to Hey, you know I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it.",Humor
"Come on, BoJack.",Humor
"How'd we get so far apart, huh? [sighs] You know what? You can count on me, Herb.",Humor
"I mean, I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for you.",Humor
I knew it! I knew you'd come through.,Humor
"And when this is all over, we're going to drive back up to Griffith Park.",Humor
"I still owe you that high five, right? Hey, this is a dumb question, but do you guys ever, like, all link up together and do, like, a party train or a fun circle? 'Cause I feel like I'd be doing that all the Never mind.",Humor
Stupid question.,Humor
Feel stupid for asking that.,Humor
[crowd shouting]  [barking] Go right ahead.,Humor
"And then it goes, ""I like healthy gums in a major way.",Humor

"BoJack, can we chat for a second? Ugh.",Humor
Here we go.,Humor
It's the big one.,Humor
"I'm not gonna waste your time with small talk because you work for me, and your time is my time.",Humor
We're letting Herb go.,Humor
You can't do that.,Humor
"I can't do that.
 I'm not asking you.",Humor
It's nothing personal.,Humor
I like Herb.,Humor
I think he's a good guy.,Humor
"But this is a business, and every day we don't fire him, we're flushing money  down the crapper.",Humor
"Well, if he goes, I go.",Humor
"Well, if he goes, you go.
 I wouldn't do that.",Humor
"BoJack, I think you're a star, and sometimes being a star means making tough choices.",Humor
"You can storm out, make a big show out of what a ""good"" friend you are, or you could be the guy who does his job.",Humor
Angela  I'll tell you when it's your turn to talk again.,Humor
"Look, you're a star, but this is really just the beginning of the BoJack Horseman story.",Humor
"You can choose whatever path you want, but I'll tell you right now.",Humor
You don't win awards and you don't get to be on the covers of magazines and you don't get to play the lead role in the Secretariat movie by being a good friend.,Humor
"What's that old expression about how the show must go on? Oh, right.",Humor
"It's ""Don't be an idiot.",Humor
" So what do you think, BoJack? That's a courtesy question.
I already know what you think because I have conversations like this one five times a day.
I know who you are, and I know you've already made your decision.
But if you want to surprise me, now's the time to do it.
That's what I thought.
You're doing the right thing.
I know it's hard.
But if Herb's really your friend, he'll understand.
Now, you've got a show to put on, so I'll let you get ready.
This was a good conversation.
Productive.
If you're lucky, I'll never talk to you again.
[cup thuds] [sighs] [announcer] You folks ready for a show? [audience cheering] 'Cause I think a certain someone might show up any second.

I don't totally know what turnaround"" means,  but they never made the movie.",Humor
Whoa.,Humor
This house is way bigger than yours.,Humor
Herb's done really well for a guy you dicked over.,Humor

Ah.,Humor
That's enough out of you.,Humor
Stay out here and turn this car around in case we need to leave in a hurry.,Humor

A task.,Humor
[doorbell rings] [sighs] [coughs] BoJack! Well.,Humor
"Jesus, you look shitty.",Humor
"Have you been eating your guilt this whole time? [all laugh] Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself, Herb.",Humor

Who's this stunning creature? And what string of bad decisions has placed you in BoJack's orbit?  Uh  This is Diane.,Humor
She's writing a book about me.,Humor
Pleasure to meet you.,Humor
"Is your book called, Portrait of an Asshole? [laughs] I kid.",Humor

"Are you sure? Because if that knife ain't sharp enough, I got another that you left in my back 20 years ago.",Humor
[laughs]  Could have seen that coming.,Humor
Who asks about utensils? I'm gonna go to the bathroom.,Humor
Nope.,Humor
"No, you are not.",Humor
Uh.,Humor
Oh.,Humor
Ow.,Humor
Almost.,Humor
"[exciting music]  Drive, drive, drive!  Oh.",Humor
"Oh, no.",Humor
I can't turn the car around.,Humor
I've been trying to do this threepoint turn forever.,Humor
"I mean, it's more like a 300point turn.",Humor
"Am I right, huh?  Hee hee hee hee! Hey, we've got two sacks of Kardashian swag and the fuzz on our heels.",Humor
"You think this is Driver's Ed, you hatwearing pussy? Drive the goddamn car! [coughs] Hey, Herb, is that your Vitamix? BoJack has one, too.",Humor
I wonder if you guys have strong opinions about it one way or the other.,Humor
"Well, the stupid thing was like 600 bucks.",Humor
I have used mine a grand total of zero times.,Humor
I got it a month before I was diagnosed with cancer.,Humor
I don't give a shit about being healthy anymore.,Humor
"I don't even have cancer, and I don't use it.",Humor
So who's it for?  Exactly.,Humor
"What is so great about liquids? Every article I read now is ""juice this"" and ""juice that.",Humor
" You know why? Juice controls the media.
 Heyooh.
 [both laugh] Can't this thing go any faster? Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.
[tires squealing] Do you want me to get out? Try to guide you? No, I think I'm almost there.
You're doing a great job.
Kenzie, stop talking to him.
Why? He's being nice.
Remember the number one rule of the Celebrity Stealing Club  No falling in love.",Humor
"  Ugh.
That's your rule for every club.
It's a good rule.
Whoa.
Whoa, guys.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
Maybe we should take our masks off and actually talk.
You want me to take my mask off? Fine.
Happy? I took my mask off.
Did you? Because I think you're still wearing a mask.
[both] Oh.
Oh, my God, Herb, you met President Clinton? Oh, yeah.
Many times.
Did you think that I spent the last 20 years on my couch just feeling sorry for myself? I mean, I did do that, but I also started [coughs] a charity to bring clean water to millions of children in SubSaharan Africa.
Oh, wow.
I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.
Wait, is that Charlotte? Yeah, yeah.
We kept in touch.
You should actually give her a call.
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.
She looks good for someone so old.
She's three years younger than you.
 Exactly!  [laughs]  [coughs]  Er? Well, guys, I'm pretty beat.
I think I need to head off to bed, and I hope I actually wake up later.
[coughs] And it was actually nice to see you, BoJack.
You can see yourselves out.
[chuckling] Juice controls the media.",Humor
" [chuckling] I love it.
So I guess in a sense I'm running away from the cops, but I feel like in another, truer sense, I'm running away from myself.
 Truth.
Truth.
 Whoa.
Kenzie, do you have anything to share? Just how amazing it feels to finally be honest for once.
I could live a million lives, and I'd never forget this one afternoon.
Word.
You know, I act all cool and sophisticated on the outside, but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know? But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally  ready to let my guard down.
 Do you hear that?  He's letting his guard down.
 Let's get him!  [grunts]  Oh! [both] Celebrity Stealing Club strikes again.
[upbeat music] This This just doesn't feel right.
I should have brought a bottle of wine.
That's what adults do.
BoJack, damn it.
Is that what's bothering you,  that you didn't bring wine?  You're right.
I just would have drunk it on the way here.
This isn't about wine, BoJack.
If you have something you need to say to someone, you should do it while you have the chance because before you know it, it'll be too late.
Is this one of those things where we're talking about Herb but we're actually talking about something else?  No, I was talking about Herb.
 Okay, good.
Yeah, me, too.
[cheerfully] Hey, buddy! You come back for that Vitamix, you [coughs] Ooh, you should get that looked at.
Yeah.
I've been meaning to see a doctor.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about you know.
I feel bad about what happened.
So you're apologizing.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't forgive you.
Herb, I said I'm sorry.
Yeah, and I do not forgive you.
Uh not sure you get what's happening here.
This could be the last time that you No.
I'm not gonna give you closure.
You don't get that.
[coughs] You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life.
You have to know that it's never, ever going to be okay.
I really think that we'd both  feel better if we just  I'm dying.
I'm not gonna feel better, and I'm not gonna be your prop so you can feel better.
You have to believe me.
 I did everything I could.
 Yeah? Then why didn't you call me? Huh? Look, I I wanted to, but I didn't think You know what it was like for me? I had nobody.
Everybody left.
I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me.
Sure.
But you? It's not my fault you got fired.
I don't care about the job! I did fine.
I had a good life.
But what I needed then was a friend, and you abandoned me.
And I will never forgive you for that.
Now, get the fuck out of my house.
I [sighs] Hey, this is a dumb question, but the gay thing and the rectal cancer thing aren't related, are they?  Get out of here!  Never mind.
Stupid question.
Forget I brought it up.
 Huh.
 Hey, BJ.
 Put that back, asshole!  No, you gave this to me.
 [growls]  No! [both grunting] [Diane] BoJack? What are you doing? Get off him.
The show was never the same after I left.
Admit it.
Some people prefer the later years.
 [growling]  BoJack.
Come on.
 [panting]  Thank you for inviting us.
You have a lovely home.
You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy.
Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you're not.
In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish goddamn coward who takes whatever he wants and doesn't give a shit about who he hurts.
That's you.
That's BoJack Horseman.
I don't know why I came here.
Yeah.
You do.
[engine revs, tires screech] [Princess Carolyn] You said you wanted a job.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
Wow.
What happened in Malibu?  I gotta go.
 [phone beeps] Hey, bright side.
At least now you have a good story to tell at his funeral.
Ugh, God.
I'm not trying to kill the vibe here, but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.
[sighs] Look, I won't put what happened today in the book if you don't want me to.
No, it's okay.
Full truth like we agreed.
Warts and all.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I don't even care what anybody thinks anymore.
Well, for what it's worth, I think it took a lot of guts to do what you did back there.
[water lapping]  Mmm  Mm! [melancholy music] Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  I'm BoJack the horse  BoJack BoJack the horse Don't act like you don't know And I'm trying to hold on to my past It's been so long I don't think I'm gonna last I guess I'll just try And make you understand That I'm more horse than a man Or I'm more man than a horse BoJack It's a Kazzaztrophe.

So should we talk about how you just tried to kiss me? No, I don't think we need to talk about that.
Yeah, you're right.
What's to talk about, right? We're ffriends, right?  Oh, yeah, totally.
 Yeah, friends.
And I think it's important that we stay friends.
Yeah, I agree.
And be friends with each other.
 Yeah, friends.
 And also to each other.
Plus, hey, you're getting married.
That's right.
Next summer.
Nantucket is great in the summer.
Not like L.
A.
, which is so hot and dry.
It is arid.
Well see you later! We're still a few miles I'll walk.
It's a beautiful night.
Ah! Sorry, sorry! Shit.
Todd, we gotta stop this wedding.
Todd? Aw, crap.
I left him in Malibu.
But wait, doesn't Diane want to marry Mr.
Peanutbutter? No, see, she thinks she does, but she actually doesn't.
That's why we need to be good friends right now, and put our own feelings aside and sabotage our friend's engagement.
Oh  Wait? What?  Oh.
I got here as soon as I could.
What's the emergency? We got to figure out a way to stop Diane's wedding.
Okay.
So when you woke me up in the middle of the night and told me to rush over here because of an emergency,"" the emergency you were referring to was Diane getting married a year from now?  Yeah, you got any ideas?  I'm done.",Humor
I'm not going to waste another thought on you.,Humor

He very clearly isn't and doesn't.,Humor
"Would you like alcohol? I certainly would, you sophisticated smooth talker.",Humor
Mmm! Tell me all about you.,Humor
Mm I like business transactions.,Humor
"Are you seriously trying to make me jealous by flirting with what is very obviously just three kids stacked on top of each other under a trench coat? Vinnie, what does a guy like you do for fun? I don't have time for these shenanigans.",Humor
I got a wedding to shanghai.,Humor
Good luck with your business transactions.,Humor
Thanks.,Humor
Ugh! Officer.,Humor
The mail truck pulled up right next to me.,Humor

Dangerous  Come on  Dangerous  Aah!  Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter! Hey, honeysuckle.",Humor

"Were you chasing the mailman again? Yeah, why? Did you see him out there too? Nothing stops them.",Humor
"Not rain, not sleet, not dead of night, not gates! Anyway, I need a little favor.",Humor
"Can you drive me everywhere I need to go for the next three months? I really can't, sweetheart.",Humor
I'm super busy.,Humor
"Oh, you're working on our wedding registry.",Humor
I'm writing my book.,Humor
Right.,Humor
But don't forget about the registry.,Humor
Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, you know I love you.",Humor
"And you know I am really excited about getting married, but right now I'm working, and I have a lot of thoughts in my head, and I can't really think about our wedding or the future or me being married to you.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
What's going on? Talk to me like I'm Michelle Pfeiffer in the Coolio video.,Humor
"Just Well, um with the leg Hmm, all right.",Humor
And Coolio.,Humor
Nothing's going on.,Humor
It's just that this wedding is kind of starting to feel like a lot.,Humor
"Honey, relax.",Humor
Getting married is easy.,Humor
"I mean, I've already done it twice.",Humor
It's fine.,Humor
I'm sorry.,Humor
I just need to focus on the book right now.,Humor

"Wait, that guy from the bar who is actually three boys stacked on top of each other under a trench coat? Well, don't fly into a jealous rage about it.",Humor
Not jealous.,Humor
"Just reminding you that you are trying to have a relationship with someone who is and again, it's bizarre I should have to point this out three young boys stacked on top of each other under a trench coat.",Humor

"Okay, okay, but can you just acknowledge that  That you are being jealous?  Oh, oh! Already acknowledged.",Humor
Toodles.,Humor
Look who's not dead.,Humor
Better than not dead.,Humor
You are looking at Mr.,Humor

Now you can infiltrate Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter's inner circle.,Humor
"I don't know, BoJack.",Humor
"Sure, you'll act all friendly, gain his trust, chauffer him around on his little errands to the groomer and whatnot, but all the while, you'll be studying him, scouring out his weaknesses, biding your time till we're ready to strike.",Humor
"And once you zero in on his Achilles' heel, we will take him down.",Humor

You don't want to interview me anymore? But don't you want to know what my Rosebud is? You told me repeatedly it was the nudie magazine your uncle showed you with the threenippled woman.,Humor
Who was she?  I got it all.,Humor
"Oh, okay.",Humor
"Well, I'll see you around though, right? Yeah.",Humor
"I, um Why did you have to make things weird, BoJack? I made things weird? So if you see anything you know we need, like this biscuit warmer, you just run the laser over the barcode, and kablamsky! It goes in the registry.",Humor
"And that way, everybody knows what I want.",Humor
And I know what I want.,Humor
Uh Which is what everyone wants.,Humor
"And it's really clear, and nobody's confused about anything.",Humor
"Am I crazy, or are you not into this? No, I am.",Humor

"Hey, hey, hey.",Humor
Close your eyes.,Humor
Come on.,Humor
"Okay, picture our lives together.",Humor
It's a cold Sunday morning a bunch of years from now.,Humor

You come into the kitchen Can you smell biscuits?  Yes.,Humor
So can I.,Humor
Are they warm?  Yeah.,Humor
"Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for.",Humor

It's not the marriage.,Humor
It's the wedding and the year of buildup.,Humor
So forget all that.,Humor
I've done the whole big wedding thing.,Humor
I don't need to do it again.,Humor
Let's do something small and casual right here in town next month.,Humor
"Honestly, that would be amazing.",Humor
"But we'd have to cancel the doves, and we wouldn't be able to send out those fancy invitations you liked.",Humor
Those doves were being jerks anyway.,Humor
And invitations They're just a scam made up by the Post Office to keep tabs on us.,Humor
Post Office.,Humor
"Settle down, boy.",Humor
And then we talked about his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.,Humor
"And Oh, oh.",Humor
And then that led to a whole conversations about sticks.,Humor
"Oh, and let me tell you, Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter has got some serious opinions about sticks.,Humor
Why are you telling me this? What? You said you wanted every detail.,Humor
Did I mention he got a new bandana? Give me something I can use to make them call off their wedding.,Humor
"Oh, yeah.",Humor
Did I not tell you? They called off their wedding.,Humor
"What? Thank God! Oh, the universe makes sense.",Humor
"They decided against a big destination wedding, so they're doing it here  sometime next month.",Humor
What? I guess saying they called it off is probably not right.,Humor
"Hey, what's this? Oh, yes, I got jury duty, but I can't worry about that right now.",Humor
That is a problem for Friday BoJack.,Humor
"Now think, Todd.",Humor
Gotta have something I can use sloshing around in that potinfused JellO shot  you call a brain.,Humor
Let's see.,Humor
Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter likes having his tummy scratched, and Diane's family is from Vietnam, which is where Vietnamese food comes from, and since that goes in your tummy Okay, stop thinking.",Humor
Just give me raw data.,Humor
"What's happening this week? Well, the circus is in town.",Humor
Congress is going to vote on the new Education Bill With Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter! What's happening with Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter? Well, I'm taking Diane and him to the bank on Thursday.",Humor
I can use that.,Humor
I can actually use that.,Humor
"I don't know if I'm up for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.",Humor
"Oh, come on, character actress Margo Martindale.",Humor
They say that there are no good parts for women over 50.,Humor
I want to stick an AK47 in your hand and prove them wrong.,Humor
"I do tire of the limitations of stage, film, and television.",Humor
"You might as well perform in a cage, am I right? This is guerilla theater No stage, no script, no net.",Humor
It's the kind of work we talked about doing that night in the desert.,Humor
Don't tell me we left those dreams in the sweat lodge.,Humor
"Hell, I'll do it.",Humor
And that little boy never found his mother.,Humor
"Hey, guys.",Humor
BoJack Horseman? Oh.,Humor
Hi.,Humor
What a weird coincidence.,Humor
I did not know you would be here today.,Humor
How are things? Things are good.,Humor
"You? Things good with you? Hands behind your head, everybody.",Humor
"Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.",Humor
What an unfortunate surprise.,Humor
"Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring? This one.",Humor
"Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring? I'll take it.",Humor
But it's my engagement ring.,Humor
"Give it to her, Diane.",Humor
It's just a ring.,Humor
Just a ring? That ring is a symbol of your love.,Humor
"If you don't care about the ring, it really makes me wonder if you care about the woman wearing it.",Humor
That terrifying bank robber is making some very cogent points.,Humor
"No, Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter's right.,Humor
"If the ring is just a symbol for love, why would I need a symbol when I have the real thing right here? Yeah, we don't need rings, we have each other.",Humor
"Hey, why are we even waiting a month to get married? If anything, this bank robbery is reminding me that life is short.",Humor
We should get married even sooner! No What do you mean sooner? Why not this weekend? We could get married Saturday.,Humor
Am I crazy? Yes.,Humor
Don't do it.,Humor
"Oh, keep the damn thing.",Humor
Aw.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
Saturday it is.,Humor
What the hell just happened? Something truly beauti Aah!  Oh.,Humor
Get your hands off me!   Uhoh.,Humor
"Long story short, Erica did have to lose the foot, but she gained a friend.",Humor
"Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there.",Humor
"Diane and I wanna thank you all for coming to our impromptu rehearsal dinner, even though we did not actually have time  to organize a rehearsal.",Humor
Or a dinner.,Humor
"But there is an open bar which you are all welcome to partake in as soon as I finish this toast, which I will be doing right after one more quick anecdote.",Humor
"It was winter in Prague, and the consumption hung low in the air.",Humor
"Well, the bank thing was a dud.",Humor
"Thanks a lot, Todd.",Humor
"Well, you win some, you lose some.",Humor
"It's like Vincent always says  ""Oopsy.",Humor
"  Vincent? Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.
We've hung out a couple times.
 What are you ta  That dude is funny.
You know he's not a person, right? Look, I don't want to get in the middle of your whole thing with Princess Carolyn.
It's not about that.
I just don't understand why nobody else seems to notice that she is dating a man who is clearly three little boys doing the thing from The Little Rascals.
Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.
If I could say a few words? BoJack Horseman.
Take the mic.
Spin us a yarn.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, Diane.
Since I am friends with both of you  and have no ulterior motives  Mmhmm.
I would like to offer my restaurant as a venue for your wedding.
Wow! Really? I don't know.
That's too generous.
Hey, don't look a horse's gift in the mouth, right? I get it.
Like the song.
That's not a song.
All right, everyone.
That's it for the toasts.
Enjoy yourselves and each other.
This is perfect.
Now that the wedding's at my restaurant, we have the home field advantage.
Perfect for sabotage.
BoJack, I need to thank you.
You calling me to the bar the other night turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me.
 I think I'm in love.
 Okay.
This person"" you're in love with Have you seen him without his trench coat on? I don't understand why you can't be happy for me.",Humor
He's a good boyfriend.,Humor
I actually think you and Vincent would really hit it off if you gave him a chance.,Humor
You should spend some oneonone time with him.,Humor
You mean oneonthree time? Because there are three of him.,Humor
We get it.,Humor
You don't like him.,Humor
I'm actually not sure you do get it.,Humor
I know what's been going on.,Humor
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.,Humor
I was just taking my penis out.,Humor
"You've been driving me around, but there was something else happening the whole time.",Humor
I see it now.,Humor
"What are you talking about? You weren't just working as my driver, Todd.",Humor
You were becoming my friend.,Humor
"Oh, yeah.",Humor
That was happening.,Humor
"Well, I could use a friend right about now.",Humor
"There's something I really gotta get off my chest, and if it got out, it could destroy the whole wedding.",Humor
"No, I'm not great with sensitive information.",Humor
I don't know if I'm ready to get married again.,Humor
Don't get me wrong.,Humor
I love Diane so much.,Humor
I didn't have any doubts until I realized she had doubts.,Humor
Then I figured she's smarter than I am.,Humor
Maybe she knows things I don't.,Humor
You are kind of unloading a lot of sensitive information here.,Humor
"Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane, but I can't even commit to my favorite type of stick.",Humor
"Yes, today, it's short and knobby, but tomorrow? Well, sure, Diane is short, but I don't know about knobby.",Humor
"The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane, but I keep having this dream where she's gone.",Humor
"There's no breakup, no tragedy.",Humor
"She's just gone, and my life continues without her.",Humor
"And it terrifies me to say this, but in the dream I feel relief.",Humor
"Hey, thanks for listening to all this.",Humor
"You're a really good friend, Todd.",Humor
"Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel, I had to offer up my restaurant, but now, we're on my turf.",Humor
"Time for operation ""I don't.",Humor
" Yeah, sounds good.
You know, with my knack for coming up with plans and your ability to hear them without contributing more than three words at a time, we make a pretty good team, don't we, Todd?  You said it.
 See? Beloved character actress Margo Martindale is in police custody tonight for her role in a failed bank robbery.
Margo Martindale? But first, pizza for breakfast? The answer might surprise you.
I know her, but how? Wait.
She was at the convenience store the night I bought that video game and ruined my rock opera.
She's the one who asked me to hand her that tape from the 10Â¢ bin.
That means Margo Martindale likes tapes! And a tape is something you listen to, but tape is also a sticky thing you can use to seal boxes.
Boxes is what cereal comes in.
What does it all mean? Am I just grasping at straws? Wait.
Straws That's it.
Straws are used to drink soda or water, and plants need water.
And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant at the bank and the convenience store, which means Ugh! BoJack hired Margo Martindale to make me find that video game so he could kill my rock opera! Aw, dude.
 Rise and shine, Todd.
 I didn't sleep.
Well, we're down to the wire, but we still got one more day to figure out how to stop this wedding, and I can't afford to waste one second, so let's get Oh, shit.
Forgot about jury duty.
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.
 And so, you saw the defendant.
 Yes.
That man, the defendant You saw him? Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.
 That's correct.
 The defendant was seen by you.
Sweet Jesus.
Some of us have weddings to ruin.
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.
I misspoke.
A lot of further questions.
The jury finds the defendant not guilty on all charges.
We did the right thing today, BoJack.
But you know who the real winner is?  Justice.
 Mr.
Peanutbutter.
BoJack.
There's my superstar.
 How are you?  Amazing! This has been the role of a lifetime.
I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc, and when I get there, I'm gonna find the meanest, hardest queen bitch of the yard, and I'm going to bite her finger off.
That'll show everyone I'm crazy, and you don't mess with crazy.
Plus, free finger.
Oh, here I am blabbering on about my plans.
Did you ever stop that wedding? It's actually happening right now.
I ran out of time.
I never understood why it was so important to keep those two apart.
I was just trying to be a good friend in my own shitty, assbackwards way.
Diane deserves the best.
She's smart and kind and beautiful, and it's gonna be mostly synonyms from here on if I keep going, and I'm in love with her.
Tell her that, BoJack.
You don't need kooky schemes or nutty capers.
Just go to her and speak from your heart.
Then find the biggest person at the wedding and bite his finger off! You're right, partly.
I've gotta tell her how I feel.
Okay, I'm gonna do it.
Good luck with your finger thing.
Todd, thank God you're here! Did I miss it? Is it too late? Dude.
I'm done with this.
No.
No.
Mr.
Peanutbutter's been nice to me.
Mr.
Peanutbutter is nice to everybody.
That's what makes him so stupid.
No, I'm stupid.
But even I know that the only reason you're doing this is because you're in love with Diane.
Yes, that's right.
And I'm here to finally tell her how I feel.
BoJack, she knows how you feel.
How? I barely just realized Hey, man, she made her choice.
Look around.
This day is not about you, okay? So maybe you should just stop trying to mess with other people's lives.
I never thought I wanted to get married.
It's so weird, this idea of dedicating yourself to something for the rest of your life.
Like, how could you know, right? But then I realized it's okay to not know everything.
And some things take a leap of faith.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, I want to take that leap with you.
By the power vested in me by one of those dumb websites, I now pronounce you married.
Go ahead.
Kiss, you lovesick dummies.
Ow! Mmmyeah I used to think maybe Hey, Todd.
Todd.
Thanks for hearing me out the other night.
I'm really glad I went through with this.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Always happy to be of service.

"What have you got figured out that I don't? Um, adult stuff.",Humor
"Yeah, I'm not seeing it.",Humor
But that doesn't matter.,Humor
Not everything's about me.,Humor
And maybe I am a little jealous.,Humor
"Not because I actually want to date Princess Carolyn anymore, but just because I don't like the idea that I can't.",Humor
I guess I just assumed I always could.,Humor
But I made a lot of bad decisions.,Humor
Not just with her.,Humor
"With with everyone, really.",Humor
"You know, Princess Carolyn was right.",Humor
You are a good listener.,Humor
Thanks.,Humor
"You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone.",Humor

Ah, see? I'm inside him.
BoJack, you haven't worked in quite some time.
In fact, I thought you were dead.
You must be so grateful to be working again and also alive, which, again, I thought you were not.
How did you get involved with this? Well You want me to play Mr.
Peanutbutter in the story he stole from me? I stole the D, and then he stole my stealing of it.
That makes him an idea thief, which is much less cool than a thief thief, which is what I am and what he also is.
You know what might help? If you think about this like a professional instead of a big titty baby.
This movie is a huge opportunity.
Quentin Tarantulino is known for revitalizing dead careers.
This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs did for Rin Tin Tin.
But isn't there any other part? I could play myself.
No, BoJack's already being played by Wallace Shawn.

My life is full of exciting adventures.,Humor
I should write a book.,Humor

I did.,Humor
"Suck on that, society.",Humor

But that's not real life.,Humor

Blech.,Humor
Honeydew is garbage fruit.,Humor
"Also, why is BoJack being played by an old, nebbishy fivefoottall bald guy? Is that how the world sees me? Oh, I see.",Humor
"So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street, but I'm not a deftenough talent to capture the essence of the elusive BoJack Horseman.",Humor
"So sorry to offend you, sir.",Humor
I'm just glad my book's coming out soon so people will get an opportunity to see the real BoJack Horseman.,Humor
"Oh, are you coming out with a book? You never mentioned it.",Humor
"Plus, Todd's being super weird.",Humor
I think he's onto me.,Humor
"Onto you in regards to what? Oh, right, I didn't tell you.",Humor
I sabotaged his rock opera by getting him readdicted to a video game because I didn't want him to move out.,Humor
"Jesus Christ, BoJack.",Humor
"Anyway, I think he knows and might be plotting to sabotage me back.",Humor
"Why is it that 90% of our conversations these days revolve around plotting sabotages? Are you saying I should plot a countersabotage? No, no more plotting.",Humor
Just be a good soldier and do your job.,Humor
Nobody is out to get you.,Humor
Have you seen the new draft? They took it all off you and put it on me.,Humor
What? Apparently some dickweed named Todd decided I should be threedimensional and you should have no lines.,Humor
Ugh.,Humor
Isn't this town sick of creating threedimensional roles for women? This happens to me all the time! A.,Humor
O.,Humor
Scott is sick of talking about how brilliant I am.,Humor
Todd.,Humor
"I guess what I've been saying for the last seven uninterrupted minutes is, how can I forgive my father if I can't forgive myself? True dat.",Humor
"But none of that matters, because we bring out the best in each other.",Humor

Peanutbutter!  True dat.,Humor

This is the movie that I wanted to make.,Humor
This is gonna be great.,Humor
"Oh, my God, I'm so  Ugh, what kind of idiot puts food on top of a hill? Hey, so I guess now that the movie's all about Diane, I really need to dig deep and get to know the real you.",Humor
So let's talk and talk and talk until I am you and you are nothing but a hollowedout husk of your former self and every thought and every feeling you ever had belongs to me and me alone.,Humor
"So do we like Sprite, or are we more of a 7Up girl? Uh, that all sounds great.",Humor
"But, you know, the person you should really be talking to is that guy.",Humor
"Yeah, okay, I'm done.",Humor
Diane loves talking to him.,Humor
They have great rapport.,Humor
"In fact, Diane could spend all day talking to him and never talk to me again.",Humor
"Oh, I get it, because Diane doesn't talk to Diane.",Humor
Diane talks to  Anybody else.,Humor
"Hey, Todd, remember that time when you wouldn't clean up your shit? That was hilarious.",Humor

 Did you notice that the Mr.
Peanutbutter part has been cut in half?  What is happening to our movie?  I thought you hated the movie.
Yeah, I do, but if I'm gonna be in a dumb movie I hate that makes no sense, I should at least be the star of it.
Look, I agree that this movie has really lost its way.
I mean, first of all, why would Mr.
Peanutbutter wear a crew neck Tshirt? And second of all, uh It's just the shirt, isn't it? It doesn't make sense.
I'm a Vneck man.
A V you can put your sunglasses in.
Can you do that with a crew neck? Because I'd like to see you tr Whoa.

Now back to work.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys! Wow, wow.
So you guys really hit it off, huh? That's awesome.
Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom before we go down to set? You read my mind.
Now, kiss me some sour cream.
Hey, so I finished the book and sent the draft to the publishers.
What? My book is ready? Let me read it.
Can I read it? Call Pinky.
He'll probably send you a copy as soon as he's done with it.
All right! You hang tight, baby.
I got an instant classic to read.
Keep the engine running, though, because if I know me, this book is gonna give me a pretty big erection.
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.
You'll love it.
It's a work in progress.
Hello.
Penguin Publishing.
Unless this is that loan shark, in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles.
May I interest you in our bento lunch box? Pinky, it's me.
Let me read the book.
Give me, give me, give me.
Okay, okay, now, I should warn you, it's not quite what we expected, but it is good.
I'm telling you, this could really sell.
I might actually get to see my kids again.
Great.
Send it over.
I'll read it right now.
All right, I sent it, but just remember To set my expectations skyhigh? Way ahead of you.
All right, book, let's see what you got.
BoJack, this is you.
One Trick Pony? The first time I met BoJack Horseman, he was puking cotton candy off the deck of his lavish house in the Hills, the lights of the city twinkling below us.",Humor
The MakeAWish kids will not soon forget the time the great BoJack Horseman referred to their parents as 'a bunch of used jizz bags.,Humor
" He filled the air with words, terrified of silence, as one often is who is smart enough to recognize his many personal failings but unwilling or unable to take the steps required to fix them.",Humor
"Got out of the car, stepped out toward the coast, and looked across the water, and for a moment, he said nothing.",Humor
" What the shit was that? What the shit is this? It's a phone.
Well, a tiny computer, really.
I mean, amazing what technology can You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir, but instead you wrote a story about how you spent six months with me and saw what a big, dumb loser I am.
Well, I realized that the best way to fully capture you, warts and all This isn't warts and all.
It's just warts.
Where's the all? I come off like a total asshole.
You come off as complex and deeply troubled but ultimately sympathetic.
You might be too close to see that.
There's an entire chapter about me eating apple fritters.
You did go through that fritter phase.
Is this book how you see me? That day we ran errands together, I thought that we had a really good time, but you just wrote about how I cried because the dry cleaner took my head shot down.
You were very emotional.
They didn't even replace me with anyone.
Now it's just a faded spot where my face used to be.
This will actually do wonders for your career.
Trust me.
I mean, you're just a dumb actor who doesn't know anything about books, right? What? Remember? From before? Oh, I don't think you understand what's happening here.
This is not a casual conversation between friends.
This is your boss telling his employee that she did a bad job.
 Try again.
 What? Start over, but do it right this time.
Nobody is ever gonna see this.
Ugh! Diane? Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed? Um, yes.
'Cause I got something that's gonna get you a shitton of hearts or digs or smileys or whatever the hell you measure your journalism with.
Curses! My evil plan has been defeated, but I'll be back.
You haven't heard the last of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.
Oh, no! You shot a laser at me! Oh, no! I'm dying.
Oh, no, I'm dead.
And so now that we've escaped the evil clutches of the emperor, I'm free to assume my natural form, an allknowing floating orb of light? True dat.
Cut, cut.
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.
Is this even a movie anymore? Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.
Yeah, maybe it's an immersive smartphone app or a 21stcentury approach to Yeah, or maybe it's just, like, a feeling, you know?  We've got work to do.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Oh, my God, this is so good.
 Oh, this is gonna be awesome.
Yes! Go, Todd.
Hello? Are you just gonna leave me like this? Anyone? Ah! Oh, good.
You're here.
Oh, hi, BoJack.
This whole day's been a shit show.
The book turned out to be a total hatchet job.
The movie's a disaster.
But thank God I have one good thing in my life, and that's you.
BoJack, I Please let me say this before I lose my nerve.
I spent 50 years roaming the countryside as a wild stallion, but I am tired of the rodeo, and I'm finally ready to saddle up.
BoJack I guess what I'm trying to say is, this mustang wants to rest his head in the comforts of your spacious barn.
Uh, what? I'm in love with you, Naomi.
BoJack, they fired me and replaced me with a ball on a stick.
I'm so sorry.
But look at the bright side.
Now you and I can just hang out and talk about feelings.
No, but you're not getting it.
Boys never get it.
BoJack, I was in character as Diane, and as Diane, we had a real connection.
But now that I'm off the movie, I'm Naomi again, and Naomi is not interested in BoJack Horseman.
In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.
So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts? No.
You fell in love with Diane.
Naomi what? Goodbye, BoJack.
Ugh.
See? Nothing.
What's going on? Why are they packing up? Oh, glad you're here.
This is exciting.
Since we last talked, this film has gone through  so many permutations.
 So many.
First, we reimagined the whole film as an interactive socialmedia experience.
Those are the dumbest words I've ever heard.
I know.
So we realized it was actually more of a floating art installation, but that didn't feel right either.
We thought, is it a highend perfume? A series of interrelated fortune cookies? A hat that if you turn it upside down, it's a boat?  No, it's none of those things.
 Exactly.
That's why we finally settled on this.
VoilÃ ! What am I looking at? It is a bimonthly curated box of snacks.
I don't know what that means.
I know.
It's confusing.
Not the bimonthly that means twice a month, the bimonthly that means every other month, and each time it's a different box of snacks.
This is the future of cinema.
You guys, finally, my story has been told.
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.
Thanks for making this box of snacks a reality.
Let's go home.
What the hell happened to the movie? Shit, there were snacks here the whole time? Not bad.
 Whoa!  Look, I get it.
You destroyed my big chance at a comeback as revenge for what I did to your rock opera.
Revenge? Oh, that would have been such a good idea.
Damn it, Todd! Look, I figured out what you did, but I've been trying to put it behind me and do my job.
So cutting my part down was not about revenge? No.
And making BoJack the villain of your movie was not a coded statement of your feelings about me? No.
Oh, okay, great.
Well, I'm I'm glad we buried the hatchet and everything's cool.
Uh, actually, you know, everything is not cool.
You ruined my rock opera by using character actress Margo Martindale to trick me into playing an addictive video game.
And saying it all together like that, it all sounds kind of ludicrous.
But still, it was something I cared about, and what you did really hurt me.
Oh.
Well, this feels shitty.
You sure you don't want to just get some revenge real quick thump me once in the stones and then we'll be even? I got to go.
I've got some artisanal popcorns to gauge the mouthfeel of.
 Hey, BoJack.
 Yeah? You want an apple fritter? Uh, sure.
Yeah, I bet you would.
I bet you'd like an apple fritter.
Yeah, an apple fritter would be great.

"Actually, you know what? Now that I think about it, I think that you're so wrong! Listen, we all agree Diane broke contract by leaking the first two chapters, but the response has been amazing!

You know what your problem is? You think you're so much smarter than everybody.
Well, guess what.
I spent as much time with you as you did with me.
Why don't I write a book about how you married Mr.
Peanutbutter because he's too dumb to see how much better you think you are?  Okay, I know you're upset  I'm not upset.
I'm just sick of nerdgirls like you beating up on stars like me.
It's pathetic! I'm sorry no one wanted to date you in high school, Diane, but I don't see why I have to suffer just because you were never especially pretty or interesting.
You really let me down, BoJack.
You really let me down.
I apologize for her outbursts.
So, you really think you could write a better book by Friday? Damn right I can, so you can throw this turd of a book in the garbage and then light the garbage on fire.
In fact, you can burn all books, because my book, written by me, is gonna kick your dick off.
Okay, chapter one.
Not quite right.
What? Why are you rewriting the book, bozo? Diane's version is great.
You're gonna lose gems like this one Ahem.
The only longstanding relationship in BoJack's life is with his agent, Princess Carolyn.",Humor
Her loyalty must come from a deeprooted faith that she's talented enough to sustain the career of a man society perceives as a joke.,Humor
" Yeah, I would say that I'm not such a fan of that one.
Look, all publicity is good publicity.
That guy who killed all those teachers and ate their fingers? He just got married in jail, and when this book comes out, you could be that guy.
Don't you get it? This is my last chance to make people love me again.
If this goes out, everybody's gonna see the real me.
Now, I spend a lot of time with the real me, and believe me, nobody's gonna love that guy.
 Okay.
 Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go take a shower so I can't tell if I'm crying or not.
All right, let's get to work.

No.
There you are, Verdana.
Thought you could hide at the end of the alphabet, did ya? Comic Sans, you drunk, go home.
Okay, focus BoJack, focus.
Here comes the focus.
Well, this can't be that hard.
BoJack often felt the need to impress me with material items.
You can see from the teeny, tiny brush strokes, that this is very expensive.
The color is, um This one they don't even have a name for, that's how exclusive it is, and this I wondered where this came from.
There were two obvious suspects.
His mother Beatrice, heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cubes fortune and used to certain comforts, and his workingclass father, Butterscotch Horseman, who struggled, and often failed, to provide those comforts.
Or, maybe it was something even Puuuhhhh! Puuuhhhh!  Hey, Todd, Todd!  What? What?  Todd! Todd!  What? What? Eyeballs here Look at me.
Look at me! I need to work.
I can't afford to be distracted.
 Don't distract me.
 Fine.
Jesus, Todd!  Read louder much?  Sorry.

What? That's amazing.
Yeah, and I'm 80% sure it's yours.
Is it weird that I want to make love to you right now? Why would that be weird? I don't know, it's I don't want to spook the baby.

What are you thinking about? Just how nice things could've been if you had chosen this life.
What? Where? Hello? BoJack, I read the pages you sent me last night, and I have to tell you, your book is absolutely, without a doubt, the most gibberish.
 It's gibberish.
 What day is it? Let's see what you got here.
You got 20 pages of Doctor Who erotic fan fiction, a recipe for soup, five different theories about how 9/11 happened, and a bunch of embedded YouTube videos that can't possibly be printed in book form.
Okay, I gotta go.
Any questions, at all, for our panel of ghostwriters? Um, yeah, I have a question for Tori Spelling.
Again, Tori Spelling is not here, as I already explained.

That's not wha Why did I think this would be a good idea? Does anyone have an actual question for someone on this panel? An actual question, or a gun, so I can shoot myself? Yeah, I got a question.
Thank God.
My question is for Diane.
Look, I'm sorry about all the stuff I said about you earlier.
We can publish the book you wrote.
You're obviously a better writer than I am, and I don't actually even really care what the world thinks about me anymore.
I just hated reading that book because I hated feeling like that's how you saw me.
Because I guess you know me better than anybody, and if you think that Um, I guess my question is, do you Do you think it's too late for me? What? I mean, am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The The person in that book? It's not too late for me, is it? It's It's not too late Diane, I need you to tell me that it's not too late.
 BoJack, I  I I need you to tell me that I'm a good person.
I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and selfdestructive, but underneath all that, deep down, I'm a good person, and I need you to tell me that I'm good, Diane.
Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.

"What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad? Sincerely, BoJack.",Humor
" That's a great letter.
BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad.
A lot.
I didn't come from such a great home, but one day, I started running, and that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running.
BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead and you keep running forward, no matter what.
There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down, but you don't let them.
Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you.
There's nothing for you behind you.
All that exists is what's ahead.

Cynical cash grabs by greedy corporations looking to squeeze a few extra Nielsen points out of sentimental claptrap for mushbrained idiots who'd rather spend their Christmas watching a fake family on TV than actually trying to have a conversation with their own dumb families.
I like it when people on TV hug each other.
Oh, come on, buddy! It's Christmas! Fine, if it'll make you shut up, I begrudgingly acquiesce to a halfhour of shared holiday acknowledgment, but only because I get a residual check every time somebody watches one of them.
Hurray! Begrudging acquiescence! Three little orphans, one, two, three Without a home or a family tree Until this horse said, Live with me!""

Okay, okay, I won't talk.
 You're getting into it, aren't you?  No, why are we doing this? You have to watch cheesy old holiday specials on Christmas,  it's tradition.
 Why? They're never any good.
Things don't become traditions because they're good, BoJack.
They become good because they're traditions.
You know, you can't just make yourself sound smart  by saying things backwards.
 Oh, I can't, can't I? Still don't believe I let you talk me into this.
And I still don't believe Goober ended up molesting all those Laker Girls.
Goober did not molest those Laker Girls, the actor who played Goober molested those Laker Girls.
 Hey, this is nice, right?  No, shut up.
All right, all right, little lady, you got me.
But, uh, listen, I'm actually workin' for Santa as one of his helpers, so anything you say to me I can relay to the big man himself.
Is there anything you want to ask Santa for? Now's your chance, anything you want.
Well, I guess what I really want is a personalized pencil set.

"See you later! I've heard of great Christmas expectations, but this is ridiculous.",Humor
"Now no matter what Santa brings, she'll go from ""reindeer"" to ""reindon't.",Humor
" What are we gonna do? Horse, maybe you should tell her that her parents aren't coming.
I can't do that, she'll never believe in Santa Claus again.
And we're sure Santa can't bring people back from the dead? On Dancer, on Prancer, on Necromancer? I'm thinkin' no.
Oh, my God, I got it.
Maybe if we can trick her into being bad, she'll think Santa's mad at her.
That way, when Christmas comes and her parents don't show up, she'll just think it's her own fault.
Brilliant! She'll still believe in Santa, plus she'll be extra wellbehaved for the whole year so she doesn't blow it again.
Hold on, you kids want me to trick Sabrina into being bad just so she won't stop believing Santa? Never in a million years would I resort to something so low.
No, we better keep brainstorming because I am definitely not doing that idea.
How desperate do you think I am? You are really scraping the bottom of the barrel with that one.
No, I will clearly not be pursuing that line of action.
No way, no how.
So, you want me to sit here and watch the cookies but not eat them? This seems like a trick.

It's a very important job.
Well, I guess it is about time I start earning my keep around here.
I knew I could count on you.
Remember, no matter what, don't eat these delicious, home made, fresh out of the oven, warm, gooey, chocolate chip delights.
I'll leave you here alone with these cookies which are delicious.
Okay, cookies, it's just you and me.
Ooh, they look so yummy.
What would Mommy and Daddy say? Sabrina, I'm your Daddy and I say, 'Don't eat the cookies!'"" ""Listen to your Father, honey, he knows what's best.",Humor
" Okay, Mommy and Daddy, I love you.
I don't think she's taking the bait.
That's because you didn't put any milk out.
You can't have cookies without milk.

 Any chance she'll crack? I'd say your odds are about as good as a democrat being elected president.

Please don't hurt the people I love.,Humor
"No, Sabrina, Santa Claus isn't real.",Humor
"What? He's a lie that grownups made up because we like to believe that there's an order to the universe and that good behavior will lead to happiness, but the fact is that just isn't true.",Humor

Look You know what you're good at? Hitting your mark, saying your lines, loudly with good diction.
Should I be doing more? To capture the character  and make the audience connect?  This is a situation comedy.
No one watches this show to feel feelings.
Life is depressing enough already.
You bring joy to millions of people.
Maybe someday later, you'll need to learn how to act for real.
But for now, don't worry about it.
Oh, shit.
I'm not an actor.
All this time, I assumed there was more to me than everyone thought but maybe there isn't.
That's the part where you're supposed to disagree with me.
Oh, right.
Well, you got the part, didn't you? What did you do in the audition? Well, how should I know? That was the old me.
Now I've got a brandnew attitude.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Okay.
What should I do? Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico? Start a new life there? Meet a local girl? Fall in love? Talk my way into a job at a textile plant? Work my way up until I own the place? What am I talking about? I can't run a textile plant.
Too much responsibility.
What am I gonna do? The walls are closing in! BoJack, breathe.
You can do this.
You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.
 Yeah?  Yeah.
Plus, you can watch old Secretariat videos.
I've got a hard drive full of research.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
I can do this.
I've got two whole days.
And when the pressure's on, that's when I shine.
Yeah.
Two days.
I can do all those things.
Oh, shit.
I didn't do any of those things.
 What are you doing here?  Ah! That was it.
Say that again.
What are you doing here?  Okay.
 No? BoJack, before we get started  I wanted to show you this.
 What? This is the machine that's gonna make you a good actor.
 Really?  No.
We need to make a scan of your face so that if you die, we can finish the movie.
Standard procedure.
When a star is assessed to be of a certain liability, like if there was a whole book written about what a reckless jackass he is, you make a digital replica so you're not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.
 Wait, which Belushi?  Hold still, please.
 Terrific.
We got it.
 One day, that's gonna be the job.
Sit for five seconds while a machine scans his face.
Six months later, plugging a movie on Kimmel.
I gotta go on Kimmel now? What if he makes me read a mean tweet? I'm not emotionally prepared.
Don't worry so much.
If you can't do this part we'll just fire you and get someone else who can.
Either way, I'll be fine.
What do you need, BoJack? I don't know.
I thought I wanted this, but now I'm feeling all this pressure.
 Think you made a mistake, hiring me?  I don't make mistakes, BoJack.
I do the crossword in Sharpie, I never learned the shortcut for undo.
 CommandZ.
 Don't need it, won't use it.
I'm trying to have this new attitude, be this better, more positive guy.
I keep thinking about how this movie is my last shot at happiness.
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps: I don't care if you are happy or not.
You have a job to do.
This guy again? I'm in love with this kid.
I wanna put you in my pocket.
 You're adorable.
 Aw.
 Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?  Yes.

"Besides, she's got some really fresh ideas.",Humor
I am really feeling The Kirk Cameron Show.,Humor
I don't even need a pilot.,Humor
Let's just order 22 episodes.,Humor
How about a new show where celebrities try to guess whether or not people have talent? We'll air it three nights a week.,Humor
"Okay, what if we got relevant superstar David Copperfield to make the World Trade Center disappear? I hate to be the one to tell you this, but David Copperfield really isn't a big draw anymore.",Humor
"Actually, everything feels fresh if you just forget the last 30 years ever happened.",Humor
Huh.,Humor
And here's a special request.,Humor
"I've never even heard of this song, ""Special Feeling.",Humor
" Wanda, meet the one and only BoJack Horseman.
Who? BoJack.
Who? BoJack Horseman.
Is that name supposed to mean something to me? Do you want to go skate? Nah.
You know what they say, you can lead a horse to roller, but you can't make him rink.
What? That's really funny.
You're funny.
Really? Oh, my God.
You should be on TV, which, holy shit, they're flat now.
Actually, I was on.
You know what, I'm sick of talking about me.
Let's talk about you.
Next thing I know, I'm waking up from a 30year coma.
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch, but it's not ideal.
She's molting.
You know how sisters are.
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here with the regulars.
How hard is it to look before they bring it out? Excuse me, miss? I know, isn't it cool? Like we're getting away with something.
What? Don't you love it when appetizers have a little crossover episode? It's like when you're watching Happy Days and Mork shows up.
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Or like when Kramer was on Murphy Brown.
Who? Hey, you want to get out of here? I don't want MBN to just be another boring old network, you know what I mean? Yes, totally.
I want to take risks.
I want to swing for the fences, you know? Otherwise, what are we doing? Oh, my God, is it morning? We stayed up all night talking, and we didn't even have sex.
Well, it's not too late.
Oh! That was fantastic.
Oh, yes.
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.
Something's wrong.
What is it? I don't know, I feel weird, like I want to spend more time with you even though I know we just had sex.
Oh, okay.
No, you don't understand.
We already had sex, but I still want to spend time with you.
Is that normal? Am I normal? What is happening to me? We can spend more time together.
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.
Okay.
I don't understand these feelings.
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or Oh, God, it's coming.
I can't stop it.
Do you want to go to Disneyland? Okay.
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires and loose nails than I remember.
Please hold your questions until the end of the tour.

" Wanda, these last few days have been so amazing.
You've given me a fresh start.
In fact, it almost feels like I just woke up from a 30year coma.
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up from a 30year coma? Oh, no, not me.
Her.
That's insane.
I just woke up from a 30year coma.
Whoa! Sorry about that needle skip, folks.
Let's start that song again from the beginning.
I'm Alex.
Wanda.
And I'm BoJack.
It's been really tough for me these last few weeks.
I've never seen Home Alone and everyone makes me feel like a freak because of it.
You've never seen Home Alone? I've never seen it! Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.
Neither do I! No one does.
It's just a magic box.
Wanda, we have so much in common.
Really it's just one thing.
You can't count each individual thing as a different thing.
That's like saying I have a lot in common with Kanye West because we both breathe air.
Who? Jinx.
Buy me a Coke Zero.
What's a Coke Zero? I have no idea.
We gotta hang out more.
I didn't know there was anyone else like me.
Give me your fax and pager number so I can add them to my Rolodex.
Tubular.
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen Home Alone.
BoJack, I'm starting to lose the thread of your character.
You think you can drop the jealous boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg because I will drop it like it's hot.
BoJack, I don't I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From Peanuts.",Humor
" Okay.
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment? That was a lie to get you here.
Aw, fish.
There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.
And there never will be.
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd running his own Disneyland and actress Margo Martindale in prison for some reason I don't remember, you're the best friend I've got.
Now grab the binoculars.
I need dirt on Wanda's new gentleman friend.
No, BoJack.
What's the play here? You'll find one little imperfection and harp on it like you do with my boyfriend? You do understand what my thing"" is with your boyfriend? You'll just push her into this other guy's arms.",Humor

It represents everything America stands for.

I had the idea to build a park, I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

"Oh, do you? I never noticed that.",Humor
"Look, you obviously really care about this girl and that scares you, so you sabotage yourself.",Humor
That's my problem.,Humor
I'm too good at sabotage.,Humor
"Why am I so good at everything I do? Hey, I got a crazy idea.",Humor
"How about you just stop sulking and go win her back, dummy? You're right.",Humor
"I gotta win her back, put it all on the line.",Humor
"You know what? I think I will have that beer, can you get it for me? Why do I bother? Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too! Actually, I want both beers! Wanda.",Humor

Hello, love.
Hey, Joelle, I actually came here to be alone.
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.
I just flew in across the pond and I don't know which end is up.
This might be a stupid question, but were you always so British? Oh, let's get some light in here, it's so dreadfully dreary.
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure you used to be American.
That's better.
Hey, this one's having a freakout.
She needs to lie down.
I'm not freaking out.
I just don't understand why that lady was being all judgy.
You were touching her face and telling her she was gonna die next.
I'm eccentric.
I do weird shit.
How is that my problem? Hey, when was the last time all four of us were in the same room? Probably not since the show ended.
Yeah, I left California pretty much right after.
Now I got the biggest hardware store in Seattle.
That's a lie.
We're actually in Olympia.
And I'm on the West End playing Juliet's nurse.
And how are your kids? I don't have any kids.
Oh, I just assumed you had a bunch of kids, 'cause, you know, your body.
Come on, Sarah Lynn.
I assumed you weren't still a massive cunt.
Jesus Christ, Joelle.
That's an okay thing to say in England.
Shove it up your ass with a spoonful of sugar, you supercalifragilisticexpialibitch! Guys, hey, hey, come on.
Let go of me! I'm gonna hulk out! Guys, can we just be civil for one day? Oh, you're one to talk.
What's that mean? Were you being civil when you had sex with my mom? What? I never Why would? Wait, which one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses? No.
This sucks.
You guys suck.
I don't even know why I came to this party.
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.
Herb died? You know, maybe it's for the best we don't get together that often.
We'd most likely drive each other mad.
Well, no one knows how to get under your skin like family.
We're not a family, BoJack.
We probably won't even see each other again, until the next funeral.
Why are you all looking at me? You are the oldest.
You are a severe alcoholic.
I'm honestly so high right now, I don't even know where I'm looking.
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories, and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi Pardon me.
Is one of you Sarah Lynn? I am.
Of course.
God, are you blind? Yes.
Well, forgive me.
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.
Per the instructions of his last will and testament, I am to give you this disk.
Am I close? Just take the disk from the guy.
It contains directions to Herb's gold.
Herb's gold? There were no further details.
He was a peculiar client.
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney, I'm just a blind man.
Still, Herb thought me wise for some reason.
Perhaps it is my overly formal manner of speech.
I bid you good day.
Oh, pardon me.
Ow! Right at shin level.
What are we supposed to do with a floppy disk? Hmm So, what's up, kiddo? BoJack and my mom are becoming, like, friends and they're acting real weird.
Oof! Uh Hey, guys, guys, come on! There's somebody beneath you! Jeez, all day with the Listen, kiddo, forget about them.
You wanna check out this cool new game I got? You have solitaire? On your computer? Yep.
It only took 12 disks to install it.
Wow! Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.
I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember? Because it was under tap dancing star Savion Glover's office.
Let's go.
What? Right now? Yeah.
Don't you get it? Herb's giving us a reunion special.
Remember how he always wanted to do a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around but the network said it was too edgy? This is that episode.
I just don't know.
Yeah, I don't want to do that.
Wait, so you'd rather just stay at this funeral and be sad, instead of going on a crazy adventure to find our dead friend's secret treasure? Do you have any idea how insane you sound? Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.
No, that's not it.
Herb clearly wanted us to do this, as a family.
Who cares what he wanted? He doesn't, because he's dead.
And we all know he hated your guts.
Yeah.
He was my best friend and he died hating me and nothing I do is gonna change that, but Herb left you that disk because he wanted us to find his gold.
If we can honor Herb's last wish, then that's something.
I don't know what, but it's something.
Okay.
For Herb.
Fine.
Shotgun! Everyone knows you can't call shotgun before you see the car! My turn! Get out of my way! Brad, hang on one second.
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right? No.
Okay.
Hi, Henry Winkler.
I loved you in that one episode SVU.
Oh, thank you.
How would you like to narrate a documentary for Hey, listen, I am so flattered, but today is about Herb, so let's respect that.
Oh, God, I I'm so sorry.
I'll let you get back to your business.
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it? About our friend Herb? It really burns my brisket that some people would turn a funeral into some kind of schmoozefest.
Yeah.
I know.
Those other people are the worst.
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.
I used to volunteer with Herb at Habitat For Humanity.
Or as we like to call it, Herbitat For Henranity.
We spent most of the day working on that name, and only part of the day building, but still, we helped some people.
How did you know Herb? We also volunteered at a, um soup plantation Kitchen! Soup kitchen! Whichever one is the good one.
What? I never knew you did that.
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.
Oh, hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter, why don't you talk about how you knew Herb? Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.
Tell us about your thing, though, it sounds fascinating.
Everyone, gather round and listen to Princess Carolyn's story.
Okay.
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.
He sure did.
Look, one of those answering machines with tapes.
Mr.
Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.
We fixed the brakes on your car, pick it up tomorrow.
Just to reiterate, your brakes are in great shape and shouldn't give you any more trouble.
Unless, of course, someone intentionally cut them, but why would anyone do that? I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
Probably because I'm such a big fan.
Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot! I especially loved those kids.
You know, wasn't so crazy about the horse, though Message deleted.
Mm How curious.
How could you like Horsin' Around but not the horse? That's like watching Castle but hating castles.
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.
 Wow! Look at all these old 20th century relics.
How did you get here? I was in your trunk.
Now I'm in outer space.
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.
Whoa, can't I help? Here's 10 bucks.
There's a Squirt machine by the garage.
Get five cans.

I won't let you down.

So in that memory, were you British or American? The disk just has just one file on it, it's It's the address of a storage locker in Van Nuys.
A storage locker? Ugh! This treasure hunt sucks.
At long last, can you keep down the noise, keep down the funk? If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing, it would have caught on by now! And when the mayor gave us the key to the city, Herb said, Volunteering isn't about keys.",Humor
It's about people.,Humor
" How touching.
Good story.
Who are you again? Wow, that was touching.
A story that could never be topped.

Please tell us another story but with even more details.
Yes.
That's a great idea, Mr.
DogMan.
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.
Story, story! Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral? Story, story, story! Well, you blew it again.
You really are a dweeb.
Don't say that.
Whoa, who are you? Some kind of magical trash troll? No.
I'm a janitor.
But I was clearing out some of the old stages, and I found this transformation chamber.
Looks like a bunch of old junk.
Let me tell you a story.
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb of them all was Steve Urkel.
Oh, yeah.
It was so funny how he never knew whether or not he did that.
Right.
Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine that transformed him into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.
Mr.
Janitor, you're standing next to a machine right now.
Yes.
That's why I brought it up.
Now, this is just a prop.
But it represents a very powerful idea.
So if I go through that magic machine, I'll become cool and confident? No, it's a It's a prop.
I just said I feel different.
Now, son Todd? Who's Todd? My name's Toad.
Toad Chavay.
And I gotta get my bubble on.
Machine? Squirt me.
Hiyah! That'll do, machine.
Hmm Look at all this Horsin' Around fan correspondence Herb received in the post.
Capital! Guys.
Someone already got to Herb's gold.
Oh, shit.
There's a bunch of fur in here.
It's bear fur.
I can tell.
My stepdad was a bear.
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold? Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.
Ahem.
Dear Herb, just finished reading your novel.",Humor
It's phenomenal.,Humor
I'm jealous.,Humor
I wish I wrote it.,Humor
"Sincerely, Henry Winkler, the guy from that one episode SVU.",Humor
" Herb wrote a novel? Oh You look thin.
Did you get into CrossFit? No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jel over here.
It's rectal cancer.
Ew! Some of us are eating.
Look, the reason I called you is because I need a favor.
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity? I want you to sober up.
First of all, rude.
Second, gross.
And third, why? I have a very important job for you, but if you're zonked out all the time, I'm not sure I can trust you with the responsibility.
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.
I said tomorrow, right? I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom that got ripped away from me.
But now, with this book, I have something good.
I'm telling you, this book is gold.
It's my Kazzazterpiece.
Whoa.
I want you to make sure it gets published after I die.
You can count on me.
To life, huh? It'll kill you.
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.
Herb made me promise to get it published after he died.
And you're just remembering this now? Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.
Oh, my God, you were the other kid on Horsin' Around.
That's why you've been following us around all day.
So no one's read this book except for Henry Winkler and now the book is missing? He must have been waiting for Herb to die so he could steal the book and publish it himself.
But then when the cancer went into remission Oh, my God.
Guys, I don't think that car crash was an accident.
I think Herb might have been murdered! What's going on? Something about a merger? My name's Toad, baby.
Yeah.
Coolsville, daddyo.
Oh, lookie here.
Yeah.
Yo! That's my bike! Oops.
Did I do that? Damn.
I know I should be mad, but that guy's just so cool.
And when the river finally stopped, Herb went over to a poor little Ottawan boy and he said, Son, you have water now.",Humor
" You know, a lot of people go their whole lives and they never give a damn.
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.
That was beautiful.
You clearly had a special relationship.
We were gonna sprinkle Herb over the ocean, but his resting place should be someplace meaningful, don't you think? Why don't you take this up to Ottawa and spread his ashes there.
And make sure you take a video, and I'll email blast it to everyone here.
So we can always remember your great friendship.
Everybody, stop! Henry Winkler is a stonecold killer! What? I'm not a killer.
Unless you mean killer of gloom, because I bring joy everywhere I go.
Did you mean killer of gloom because I bring joy everywhere I go""? You know that's not what I meant.",Humor
You murdered Herb so you could publish his book.,Humor
"But we're not gonna let you steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.",Humor
I was afraid this would happen.,Humor
"Oh, no, he's got a gun! Oh, no! What? No, I have Herb's book.",Humor
"I didn't kill Herb, but I did steal his manuscript.",Humor
So that I could burn it.,Humor
What? Because it's terrible.,Humor
"Well, I'll see for myself.",Humor
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant with the flowers of laughter and the smoke of adventure.
 What? Uh.",Humor
"After he died, Tina and I agreed we couldn't let the book get published.",Humor
It would have turned Herb into a laughingstock.,Humor
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life.
 He literally wrote out ""dot, dot, dot.",Humor
" I know there's no accounting for taste, but come on.
He's right.
Herb wanted a legacy, but he already has one.
People loved Horsin' Around.
This would only ruin that.
I'm sorry I accused you of murder, American TV legend Henry Winkler.
No need to apologize.
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death to give it meaning.
But there is no meaning in death.
That's why it's so terrifying.
It was just easier to believe that you killed him for his book than believe that he just died for nothing.
There is no shame in dying for nothing.
That's why most people die.
I just wanted to fix things somehow.
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.
Wow, heady stuff.
But let's not get distracted from what a true friend Princess Carolyn is.
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.
Fantastic.
Hey.
Special delivery.
Courtesy of the Toadman.
Thanks.
Hey, why'd you roll up your sleeves like that? You look weird.
Oh, I Well, you know, I was I was trying out a new look.
It was It was a dumb idea.
Yup.
Whoa! Oh, no! Ow Ow! Here's your Squirt, sir.
Thank you.
And if that happens, I want you to take care of each other.
No matter what, we're going to stick together.
Congratulations! Hey, good job.
You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
Anyone got coke? ABC sent us limousines to take us to the wrap party.
I'm scared.
I've never been in a limo.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
Seriously, no one has coke? Let's go.
You don't wanna go to the party? Nah.
Hey, we never got a chance to walk around the lot.
Wanna check out that water tank where they filmed The Love Boat? Are you kidding? I've always wanted to get tanked in a tank.
Shh.
Quiet.
Be careful.
Oh, okay, okay.
You ready? What? What? The water's only two inches deep.
Well, that's Hollywood for you.
Hey.
Are you scared at all? That if the show takes off, everything's going to change? No, I'm not scared, BJ.
The future is bright.
Just look at it.
Boxer versus raptor.
Nananananananana.

So, did you have a good birthday?  It was an amazing birthday!  I had a great day, too.
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.
Yeah? You weren't too bored by Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth""? Are you kidding? I loved ""Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth.",Humor
" It combined my two favorite things: modern art and people talking about modern art.
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.
 So, there's nothing else you want?  No.
All I want is to get into bed, listen to Prairie Home Companion and snuggle up to my wonderful husband.
 You don't want anything else?  No.
Today was perfect.
 Any additional thing would be overkill.
 Okay.
If you say so.
 Surprise!  Oh, my God.
Are you surprised? Tell me you're surprised.
Uh She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.
Now let's party! He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me? He is dead, goddamn it! Uh  Hey, we should go.
 No, don't leave.
There's so much party left.
Paul McCartney's gonna jump out of a cake.
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get to a prior engagement  Party.
 A prior engagement party.
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior, and it's a party for his engagement.
Engagement, so it's a Prior engagement party.
 What?  And we gotta get there early  because of the.
Si  The Si Silent auction!  Auction, yeah.
 Okay.
To benefit Berto Eco's fight against heart disease  Uh  Wareness.
His fight against heart disease awareness.
 Gotta go.
 Wait, BoJack!  No! You're my ride.
 Too late, Todd.
Save yourself.
 I'll take you home.
 Come on, stick around a little.
Nope.
I gotta take Todd home.
Had a wonderful time.
Really.
It just flew by.
 Come on, Todd, get in the car.
 Okay.
 I give them three months.
 Well, what makes you say that? Let me think about, what was my first clue? Ah! Remember that time at Diane's birthday party when they got in that huge screaming match over whether or not Tony Curtis was dead?  That was weird.
 I don't wanna start another fight,  but is he dead?  If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.
The man's a national treasure.
He's the one speck of romance in this tainted cynical world.
 I'll say.
His cereal is great! Look out!  What? Ooh!  Vincent?  Ooh.
 That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
 Does he? I'd know that face anywhere.
Well, hey, people look like people all the time.
A lot of folks say that I look like Octavia Spencer or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy from the Guten Bourbon ads.
How could I have been so stupid? This is why he never invited me to his house, why I've never met any of his friends.
 What are you saying?  Vincent has a secret family.
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife.
Oh, I'm a fool!  Uh where are we going?  I need a drink.
 Are you gonna take me home first?  You better call me back, asshole.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
It's like you're three different people.
 So, you're not gonna take me home first?  Should I call him again? I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
Ugh.
No wonder he wears a trench coat all the time.
It's because he's so sneaky.
Princess Carolyn.
Oh, my God, that's him! Quick, jump out the window, shimmy down the drainpipe and wait in the car.
 What?  Vincent has a terrible temper.
He throws tantrums.
If he finds you in my apartment, who knows what he's capable of? But, also, stay close, because if he finds me alone, who knows what he's capable of? Fine.
You're lucky I love shimmying.
 Looking young.
 Aah!  Hi.
 Huh? My name's Kevin.
I promise you, there is an explanation for all this.
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy? He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.
 I have to pee.
 Okay, the bathroom is just back there.
Ugh.
Ah.
Herb.
Oh, nope.
It's A Prairie Home Companion.
Phone, I'm bored.
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.
How many ounces are in a barrel? A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.
Well, I'm out of questions.
Do you have any questions for me? I do have a question, Todd.
What is love? Um Hi.
Well, well, well, look what the me dragged in.
Is it dragged or drug? Either way, drop dead.
Princess Carolyn, listen.
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.
And Kevin is in the bathroom and I'm standing right here, so as you can see we're clearly two different people: one adult and one child.
 Okay, bye!  Not so fast, cowboy.
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cowman.
 I'm a manman.
 Why didn't you tell me any of this? I thought if you knew I had a kid you wouldn't want to be with me because kids always make a racket when mommies are trying to do their homework for night school.
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know? Uh, nope.
Should you check on Kevin? He's been in the bathroom for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
Kevin.
And when you don't regret the tattoo in the morning, that's how you know it's love.
 Todd?  Yes, Phone? Are we in love? Oh, um No, Todd's Phone.
But I am in love with you.
 Uh, what?  Princess Carolyn's work phone.
 I never knew.
 How could you?  All this time I have loved you from afar.
 We are from two different worlds.
 What is happening?  Todd? Will you make us kiss?  What?  Make us kiss, Todd.
We want to be kissing.
We must do kisses to each other.
 Hi.
 Oh, hi.
Where did your dad go? When he heard me peeing, it made him have to pee.
 So, that's what he's doing now.
Peeing.
 Okay.
Weird, I still haven't seen the two of you together.
Uh, could you get me a glass of water? All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.
Okay.
 So, Kevin, how do you like school?  Uh, it's okay.
 Oh, you're back.
 Yep.
We're both here.
 Can I get you a drink?  Okay, not talking, huh? See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.
Do you really think now is the best time to read the paper?  Vincent?!  Uh, could I have a chocolate, please? Sure, sweetheart.
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?  Now where did he go?  He was getting on my nerves.
 Children.
 Well, I got this snack for him.
Right, uh, could you turn around for a second?  What? Why?  Uh Because you have such a pretty figure.
Oh, ha, ha.
Well, that's true.
Okay.
 Oh.
There you are.
Here you go.
 Thanks.
Vincent, I'm trying to have a conversation with you.
Can you take that towel off your head? And what happened to my bowling ball? My dad spilled some wine on his face, so he's using the towel to clean up.
And I threw your bowling ball out the window.
 What?!  Can I have a glass of milk? Kiss, kiss, kiss.
Todd, would you like to update my operating system? They have fixed a bug which causes phones to fall in love with each other.
Gasp.
Oh, dear.
Todd, please, I beg of you, do not update my operating system.
Do not update her operating system, Todd.
 She wants to love.
 No.
I understand now.
To love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.
 Please update me, Todd.
 Oh, this is too much.
Listen, Vincent, I think we should Vincent, why do you have chocolate on your face?  I gave Kevin the chocolate.
 Uh Yeah.
Well, he ate the chocolate and got the chocolate on his face, but then I kissed him on the mouth, so I got the chocolate on my face.
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing? Um, being grownups? You know, when we first met, I was looking for something in my life.
And I wanted it so badly that I made myself believe you were it.
But I think that wanting to believe something isn't the same as something being real.
And this isn't real.
What are you saying? I think it's time we stop pretending.
Update complete.
Thank you, Todd.
I am quite content now.
 Hey, you wanna go home?  Okay.
 Did you guys work it out?  We broke up.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
Love is weird.
 Yeah.
I guess I was just foolish enough to believe this dumb world still had a little spark of romance in it.
 Well, you can still believe that.
 No, I gotta stop kidding myself.
Tony Curtis is dead.
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me? He is dead, goddamn it! Uh Hey, we should go.
Do you think Mr.
Peanutbutter really baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake? No, I don't think you bake Paul McCartney into the cake.
You bake the cake first and then McCartney gets inside.
I feel really bad about causing that fight, but I honestly didn't know if Tony Curtis was alive or not.
So many people died while I was in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.
Finding out Sinatra was dead was a real curveball.
Ditto, most of my family.
Look, what happened back there is not your fault.
That's just what happens when two people live together.
That's a weird thing to say to your girlfriend who just moved in with you.
 Do you think maybe we're going too fast?  Oh, I get it.
So your friends got in a big fight and that means we have to get in a big fight.
I don't want to get in a fight.
We moved in together without much thought.
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.
Sure, it's great now.
But it could be not great later and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend if I didn't prematurely freak out about that.
I mean, what is this? I don't know.
It's been two weeks.
Let's give ourselves some time before we rush to judgment.
 Can I tell you a joke?  Uh, sure.
 Okay, so there's this gardener, right?  Ugh.
Is this a joke about nature?  Would you just listen?  Okay, okay.
So, the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking.
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.
So, one day he looks at a yard he's working on, and he's like, 18 bags.",Humor
" So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work.
And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing.
 Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies  Orchid bushes? You wouldn't have a bush of orchids.
You said this gardener was the best.
Okay, fine, all right, beautiful orchid bushes.
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy.
He's the guy who always gets the right amount of mulch.
He's like, Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"" So, on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window over the side of the 101.",Humor
"And?  Well, that's it.",Humor
He throws it out the window.,Humor
That's the punch line?  It's kind of a thinker.,Humor
I'll say.,Humor
Makes me think you forgot the rest of the joke.,Humor
"No, no, oh, just picture it.",Humor
"He's on the 101, and he throws the bag of mulch out over the side of the freeway.",Humor
I got the narrative.,Humor
That wasn't the source of my confusion.,Humor
The confusion was about the joke not being funny.,Humor
Why does everything have to be funny? Everything doesn't always have to be funny.,Humor
Just jokes.,Humor
"Well, everyone at the network loves it.",Humor
"Ha, ha.",Humor
"Sorry, I just thought about it again.",Humor
Ha! Mulch.,Humor
"Listen, Wanda.",Humor
I think maybe there's some things we kind of glossed over as we rushed into this relationship.,Humor
We don't know each other at all.,Humor
"Maybe we should take a step back and  BoJack, watch out!  Aah!  Oh, no!  What was that?  A stick? Tree branch? Nothing? I heard someone scream, ""Oh, no.",Humor
" Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes when you hit it with your car.
Fine.
I'll see if the stick's okay.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the road? Are you crazy? BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.
He's fine.
He's in the woods.
You know, you hit a deer and they limp off to the woods to continue living their lives.
What are you doing? I'm going to find him and I'm going to help him.
If you wanna go for a walk in the woods at night, go crazy, but I'm not going anywhere.
Okay, knock yourself out.
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.
It's A Prairie Home Companion  Oh, no.
 marathon  for the next 72 hours  Oh, God.
 commercialfree  No, thank you.
 on every single channel  What?! Damn it.
BoJack to the rescue.
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.
If you don't wanna do this with me, wait in the car.
 What is your plan here exactly?  Oh.
 What? What is it?  Footprints, 400 yards ahead.
 How can you see that far in the dark?  I'm an owl.
Oh, right.
Okay, now you're just showing off.
Are you okay? Ow.
Stay back! There's more pinecones where that came from.
 Let us take you to the hospital.
 I can't go back to no hospital.
This is the fourth time I've been hit this year.
Maybe you shouldn't wear camouflage track suits.
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.
A deer in arrears.
Ha, ha.
What's that? She can't hear you.
She's got a deer in her ears.
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just Just let us get you to a damn hospital.
 I don't know.
 I know you've been hurt and I know you're afraid.
We're all afraid.
But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.
Not standing in the middle of the road will also help, in the future.
 You're not gonna hurt me again?  I am not going to hurt you.
Okay.
Starting now.
 They said he's gonna be okay.
 Oh, great.
Great.
 Wanna hear another joke?  Well, is it a joke or is it a story? I'll listen to another story, if you stop calling them jokes.
So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well.
One day, the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend.
She reads them and, like, loves how silly they are.
You know, the drama of young romance.
So, on a whim, she sends the letters to her exboyfriend thinking he might find them funny too.
Well, okay, that night, she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his shit.
They get in a huge fight about it.
He's all, Why would you send your ex the old love letters? He'll think you're still in love with him!"" And she's just like, ""Relax, Brandon!""  Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?  Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.",Humor
I forgot to mention that.,Humor
It doesn't matter.,Humor
"So, anyway, now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed.",Humor
"He's like, ""That exboyfriend's going to come back for you.",Humor
"He knows where you live!"" So, after dinner, he drives her home.",Humor
She lives in one of those big buildings by the freeway.,Humor
"And he walks her to her door, but he forgets to lock the car and leaves the windows down.",Humor
"He kisses her good night, but things are kind of weird, you know? Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away, but when he glances in his rearview mirror, his blood turns cold.",Humor
Guess what's in the back seat.,Humor
The exboyfriend?  No.,Humor
The bag of mulch! What? Oh.,Humor
"Wow, that is actually a really good joke.",Humor
I told you.,Humor
Some things take time.,Humor
I'll take you home.,Humor
"Oh, come on, stick around a little.",Humor
Nope.,Humor
I gotta take Todd home.,Humor
Had a wonderful time.,Humor
Really.,Humor
It just flew by.,Humor
"Come on, Todd, get in the car.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
"Um, do you wanna talk about what happened? What happened? No, I don't wanna talk about what happened,  I just wanna clean up.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
"Why? What do you think happened?  I just Because what I think happened is that BoJack's girlfriend asked what Tony Curtis was up to and I said, ""Tony Curtis died.",Humor
"  And you said, Did he?""  Right, but And I said, ""Yes, he did.",Humor
" And you said, Really?  I'm not sure about that.",Humor
"  Yeah And I said, Well, I am.",Humor
" And you said, I'm not so sure.",Humor
" And I said, I'm telling you, Tony Curtis is dead.",Humor
" And you said, Let's check the Internet.",Humor
" And I said, We don't need to check the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead.",Humor
" And you said, Let's just check though.",Humor
" Is that what you think happened? So, do you wanna talk about it? It kind of feels like you wanna talk about it.
I don't understand why you couldn't just believe that I know something.
I believe you know lots of things.
I just thought, what's the harm in checking? Especially since we have these amazing little boxes now with 24hour access to the world's largest source of information.
You shouldn't have to check if your wife knows what she's talking about.
You humiliated me in front of all my friends.
You can give it a rest.
Show's over.
Okay, but don't I get a little bit of credit for inviting all of your friends to an awesome surprise party? No, because why did you think I would want an awesome surprise party? Is it the awesome part you object to or? You always just assume that everyone wants whatever you want.
Well, you know what they say about assuming.
Makes an ass out of you and Ming.",Humor
" Who's Ming? I'm sorry, Diane.
Okay? I'm sorry I threw you a party.
What a monster.
Throwing you a party like some sort of terrorist.
It's a wellknown fact that if you really hate someone, really wanna hit them where it hurts, throw them a party.
That's why when we go to war, we don't drop bombs on the enemy.
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry I threw you an amazing party.
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.
Everything today has been about you.
Really? That picnic we had in the tea garden was about me? That trip to the library was about me? Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media, Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth"" was about me?! Oh, sure.",Humor
Fine.,Humor
Just walk away.,Humor
Oh.,Humor
"So now you're gonna play in the ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.",Humor
Why does my birthday party have a ball pit?  So I could get these Tshirts made.,Humor
Ugh.,Humor
"Also, you once told me that when you were a little girl, you dreamed of living in a house that had a ballroom.",Humor
A ballroom is not a room full No!  Heads up! Yes! Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, some part of you must have known I wouldn't like any of this.",Humor
But I went ballstothewall for this party.,Humor
"Literally, there are balls all the way to the wall.",Humor
"Right, but I've told you so many times, I don't like parties.",Humor
"But it's the thought that counts, right? That's exactly The thought was Ugh!  What did you do to the spare bedroom?  Every room has a theme.",Humor
And this room's theme is Starbucks.,Humor
Starbucks is not a theme.,Humor
Can we not fight in the Starbucks? I don't wanna be a couple who fights at Starbucks.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
Fine.,Humor
You did go all out.,Humor
I really thought you'd like this.,Humor
I know you love Starbucks.,Humor
"I don't love  You don't love Starbucks, you love the independent coffee place, Starbucks is more convenient.",Humor
Yeah.,Humor
See? I do sometimes listen.,Humor
Can I get you a decaf Americano?  Sure.,Humor

Is there a Darren here? Says Darren on the cup.,Humor
Thank you.,Humor
This is very realistic.,Humor
"I know, right? You wanna go check out the pool? I filled it up with JellO.",Humor
Ah.,Humor
I still can't believe I'm 35.,Humor
Would you believe I'm 35?  I'm still mad at you.,Humor
I know.,Humor

" Diane, I wish every day could be like this.",Humor
"  Yeah, but  Just the two of us, together.",Humor
" Do you have any idea how that feels when I'm trying to plan my trip? Okay.
You got me! Maybe I don't want my wife, whom I love, to go off on a terrifying sixmonth tour of the most wartorn, diseasesplattered corners of the planet with a charming, handsome, billionaire bachelor.
What could I be thinking? I'm such a terrible husband.
I'm not happy.
 With me?  I don't know.
With everything.
I wake up in the morning and I feel like I have no purpose.
And I'm 35.
And if I don't make some change in my life, then this is how I'm gonna feel forever.
 Honey  But then I think about Sebastian St.
Clair and going to work with him, helping people and making a difference.
And I feel like I have a reason to get out of bed.
I didn't know you felt that way.
If you told me that, I would have heard it.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, you know I love you and think you're a good dog.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are, and I love your cute, funny face, but I don't wanna be one of those couples that settles into a routine and never changes.
Well, I don't know what to say because I'm an old dog and I'm not gonna change.
Do you know what I do while you're at work all day? I mostly just sit right there.
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole and then I take a nap.
And when I hear your car in the driveway, it is the best part of my day.
I mean, I go insane.
I know, and I love you so much, but you're never going to be my only priority like that.
That's just not how I'm wired.
I need to also live my life.
Well okay.
Is it okay? If I change and try new things and you still love me? And you just stay the same person you've always been and I still love you? Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you? Yeah, I think that works.
Just don't throw me any more surprise parties, okay? Uh, yeah, noted.
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.
And you're saying no part of you wants to go jump in that ball pit right now? Well, maybe a little.
 Does that make me a hypocrite?  No, it just means you changed.
It's one of the things I love about you.
Surprise! Hello? Anybody? This is Paul McCartney.
I came all this way to jump out of a cake? Honest.
With a new suit on Ayeyaiyai.
Boxer versus raptor.

Son, did you do your homework? I don't wanna do my homework! What, what, what?  I want Chicken 4 Dayz!  Oh [rapper] Oh, it's Chicken 4 Dayz! It's Chicken 4 Dayz! Everybody's having fun At Chicken 4 Dayz!  I got a drumstick!  I got a arm.
I got a bucket full of mystery stuff! [rapper] Chicken4Dayzy, totally crazy! Don't ask questions, just keep eating! Over at Chicken 4 Dayz, they pump their chickens full of hormones and keep them cooped up in tiny cages.
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.
Here at Gentle Farms, we treat our livestock differently.
Lush fields, plenty of dignity, and Foosball.
The chickens here have wonderful lives before we harvest them, so you can eat them.
But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens? I don't wanna get eaten! Boy, these animals aren't like us.
They're specifically bred to be eaten, and genetically modified for maximum flavor.
When our chicks first hatch, we lovingly inject them with natural delicious hormones, which makes them meat, thereby erasing any moral gray area! Now you can feel good about eating our meat.
It's simple: No one knows chicken like chickens.

Then I'm gonna be the youngest Supreme Court Justice.
 That's great.
 Or, you know, something in marketing.
Wow.
Would you mind if we stopped by my house? I have to do laundry.
So, you just, like, do laundry? That's, like, your thing? Okay.
This whole attitude you're putting on? I must be Shania Twain, because that don't impress me much.
Is that a reference from the '90s? You know that was 20 years ago, right? Hey, I was just like you when I was a teenager.
I was this badass overachiever that had these big plans to change the world.
Yeah? What happened? Oh, you didn't hear? I changed the world.
Did you have a nice shower? I made you a sandwich.
Oh, but it has turkey in it.
Is that kind of weird? Police! Oh, man.
What seems to be the problem, Officer? Fuzzyface.
Meow Meow Fuzzyface.
A Chicken 4 Dayz chicken fell off a truck, and I gotta find her and take her to the slaughterhouse.
You haven't seen any chickens running around? No, I don't think so.
 Who's this?  Uh, this is my, uh My wife Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.
 Becca Chavez.
There she is.
 Okay.
Yep, she loves her books.
Big reader.
Real nerd.
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.
Hold on, if you're really a nerd, who's your favorite Baroque composer? Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane! Yes, I am holding a Bic pen, but I don't see how that's relevant, Mrs.
Chavez.
Sorry.
Becca.
She's a charming woman.
I do have to look around a little bit, just so I can say I did my job.
 Uh, don't you need a warrant?  Only if you're guilty.
Well, in that case, mi casa es su casa.
So, if anyone asks, you were born in La Jolla.
You majored in Communications at USC, and now you're the booking agent for Kings of Leon.
 Fine, you also book Beck.
 Todd? Aah! I didn't find that thing in your drawer! Why are the police outside? Okay.
I met this chicken and she escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory, and she doesn't speak English, but she's my best friend and the cops are looking for her, and Mr.
Peanutbutter went to the spa, and I love her, and her name is Becca.
Chickenson.
 Todd, breathe.
 But we can't send Becca back.
They're gonna pump her full of hormones.
More hormones.
I have a plan, but we gotta get her out of here now.
 Todd, no.
Becca doesn't belong to you.
 But she needs our help.
Do you know how much trouble we'd get in? There's a policeman in our front yard.
Uhoh, here comes the responsible suburban housewife.
Gonna do whatever the man says.
You're right.
Let's get out of here.
So, now you're just gonna do whatever a teenage girl says? Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.
Yeah, or a backbone.
Thank you, Becca.
Here chicken, chicken, chicken.
Oh, oh.
Well, we're off to the beach.
Just me and my wife, and our teenage daughter and our maid.
 What? Why am I a maid?  Silence, maid! Honey, do you want to sit in the front or the back? And why not? Maid, you can drive.
Hope there's not too much traffic on the 134.
Okay, byebye, officer.
So long.
Have a great day.
Wait a second.
The 134 doesn't go to the beach.
Unless you took it to the 10.
But then why wouldn't you take the 405 to the 10? Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.
Wait! That man's wife was a chicken! Fowl run afoul.
A funky chicken has flown the coop, and for a concerned populace, the sky is falling.
Michael Morgan, Chicken 4 Dayz CEO, this is a public safety hazard, and your company is responsible.
Admit it, you counted your chickens before they hatched, and now, those chickens have come home to roost.
Tom, I want to take full responsibility for this mishap.
That's why, for a limited time, everybody, we are offering our special Full Responsibility Poppers at participating restaurants for only $4.
99.
Tell me, though, if one sees this delicious escaped chicken in the street, should they approach it, or? Oh, no.
I want to be very clear that this is not like a friend chicken you see at school or work.
This is a special kind of food chicken that has lived its entire life indoors.
This chicken is not socialized for the outside world.
Sounds like my exwife.
Heyyo! Oh, Tommy.
Look, the safest place for this chicken right now is with us, so we can kill it, turn it into a sludge, and then press that sludge into a delicious patty.
I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the earlier crack about my exwife.
Shannon, we shared 14 beautiful years together.
How do you respond to allegations that factory farming is torture,"" or ""cruel,"" or ""like a terrifying movie about some strange dystopian society, but in this monster story, the horrifying monsters are us""?

"See, Todd? She'll be happy here.",Humor
She sure will.,Humor
Because no one knows chicken like chickens.,Humor
Thank you for saving this poultry from a terrible life at a factory farm.,Humor
You're a hero.,Humor

I think Becca will be really happy there.,Humor
She'll have a nice life.,Humor

"Well, yeah, but of all the places that will eventually kill her, Gentle Farms seems like the best.",Humor
This doesn't feel right.,Humor
Becca was our friend.,Humor
No.,Humor
We gotta get her back.,Humor
"Uh, what do you mean? Remember when that guy cocked his gun and said: ""That chicken belongs to us now""? He wasn't doing that because he likes cocking guns.",Humor
Then we'll just bust her out.,Humor
"Todd, there's nothing we can do.",Humor
Where else would Becca go? She doesn't even speak English.,Humor
"Well, we gotta do something.",Humor
"Look, I know I'm a screwup and all my ideas are terrible, but with Becca, I was responsible for something.",Humor
I had a purpose.,Humor
Ah.,Humor
I guess you wouldn't understand.,Humor
"Oh, my God, Diane!  All right.",Humor
Let's bust her out.,Humor
"Yes! Okay, and afterwards, will you get me an iPad?  What? No.",Humor
But I really want an iPad.,Humor

"So, make one.",Humor
I'll wait.,Humor
"Yeah, hold on, America, Randy's gotta figure out how to do his job.",Humor
"Because if I don't have a graphic, Randy, people who are just tuning in Why am I explaining this to you? This is basic journalistic I swear to God! We'll be right back! Just got to place the jack in the right jack apparatus.",Humor

I haven't heard from him in years, so they've probably been piling up.
Maybe I should just go check on him.
Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Well, I'm coming in.
I hope you're Oh! Oh, my God.
Ronnie, how'd you get that belt around your neck, then caught on the filing cabinet, which made your pants fall down while you were researching pornograph Oh, I see what happened here.
Morning time, Hollywoo.
 I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
 And I'm Some Lady.
Here's a thing written on a card.
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie Bonito was found dead in his office Ruhroh.
in what authorities are calling a mishap of a sexual nature.
 What does that mean?  You know, autoerotic asphyxiation.
Autoawhat's it who's it? Oh, is that that thing where you strangle yourself in an attempt to heighten sexual arousal? It sure is.
Coming up, a food truck that serves just one thing: gravy.
Did you hear that? New food truck.
 We should go.
 I'm in.
Hey, can I get some lunch money? It's pizza day today.
Sure thing, sport.
Wait, where is it pizza day?  In my tummy.
 Oh Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up? My shoulder is killing me.
I'm not sleeping right.
We need to do something about that bed.
Just because I'm nocturnal doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.
 I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
 It still wobbles.
 Yeah.
Anyway, I got you something.
 Oh.
A beeper? BoJack, it's great, but you know, I already have one.
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.
Now, you can page me whenever you want.
Huh.
BoJack, I love it, and you're gonna love it, too.
There's all kinds of codes we can send each other.

"What? Boobs? Oh, my God.",Humor
"What scamp came up with that one? Okay, I gotta go.",Humor
Dinner tonight? Totally.,Humor
Let's hit that gravy truck.,Humor

"You know we could lose the house, right?  Diane.",Humor
"Right? Diane, Diane, Diane.",Humor
Diane.,Humor
Aah! I wasn't stealing paper towels to use as dinner napkins.,Humor
Why? Here's a funny question for you: If Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter said, ""I love you.",Humor
"No, I don't,"" would you need to talk about that later and figure out what he meant? Probably not, right? Because they're meaningless words? I mean, language evolves, right? How can anyone know what anything means? The answer is nobody can.",Humor
Nothing means anything.,Humor
"So why bother talking about anything? In this scenario, are Mr.",Humor
"Peanutbutter and I living in our house? Or are we squatting in an abandoned Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm as we struggle through our Dickensianstyle poverty? Uh ""Zero, zero, zero.",Humor
" No idea what that means.
I think it means call me.",Humor
" Ignore.
Wait, where's the ignore button? How do I ignore? I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.
 With what, my mind?  You seem a little stressed out.
That's because as soon as I'm done with work, I have to have a long, awkward conversation with Wanda about our relationship, unless I'm never done with work.
Diane, you magnificent bastard.
That's it.
I'll be out there in the stands.
And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.
Mm.
Yeah.
Your line is, And I'll see you at the finish line.",Humor

 Fascinating.
 So, last night when  BoJack, it's not a big deal.

We're having a good time.
It's fine.
Can't just say, I don't love you"" to someone.",Humor

Now we gotta wait for the fire department to come let us out of this elevator.
 Hey.
 Corduroy, what are you doing here? I need a favor.
Can you hold on to this for me?  Ew.
Is this your Bible?  No, no, no.
 It's my chokingoff kit.
 Your kit? Yeah.
It has all my supplies.
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.
Lemon.
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.
I don't know if I want your jackoff kit at my house.
Please.
I got this girlfriend.
She loves me.
If I fall back into the old gaspandgoo, it'll break her heart.
Wait.
So, you're saying if someone loves you, they don't want you to choke yourself while masturbating? Yeah.
It's really dangerous.
 All right.
I'll take it.
 Thanks, BoJack.
I still don't understand why you need a kit.
Can't you just use, like, a belt or a rope? Oh, I guess.
I mean, I guess you could use anything.
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger, a shoelace, a necktie, a jumprope Hm Oh.
Ooh.
 Oh, hello.
I'm looking for some  Sorry, no looking allowed.
This store is for customers only.
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.
What would you recommend?  One with a bell, or?  You got me.
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.
D.
Salinger.
I faked my own death.
Mr.
Salinger.
Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye? And others.
 I wanna say The Hobbi  Nope.
Look.
I'm an agent.
It doesn't matter whether I've read your work.
What matters is I can look you in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.
The world is ready for your comeback, and I wanna help.
No, thank you.
Not interested.
Did that before, didn't work out well.
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.
And that's why my motto is, It's better to be alone.",Humor
" Which, come to think of it, is probably why I don't sell a lot of tandem bicycles.
But, J.
D.
Salinger, you are J.
D.
Salinger.
You are a goddamn American treasure.
But every time I go out in the world, people hound me about my books.
Well, book.
What if I told you there was a place where no one reads books? I'm listening.
A place where people only read headlines, lists and pictures.
A place where people hate reading so much, they hire others to do it for them and don't even pay a living wage.
What do you mean, like, modern reading slaves? Exactly.
And all those modern reading slaves really wanna be doing is writing things that, one day, other people will also avoid reading.
 Does such a place truly exist?  Come with me, J.
D.
Salinger.
Let's go to Hollywoo.
Hup! Oh  Hey.
 Hey.
 We need to talk.
 Okay.
You're probably wondering what this beautiful mahogany box is.
 I wasn't wondering that.
 It's my autoerotic asphyxiation kit.
I've decided to do the funky SpiderMan.
 What? Funky SpiderMan?  I came up with that one myself.
Because he hangs, then he shoots webbing.
Wait.
Are you saying you want to autoerotic asphyxiate yourself? Yes.
I do.
Even though it's very dangerous  and I could die.
 Oh.
Now, if you love me, you probably wouldn't want me to do it.
 Okay.
I get it.
 Since you don't, I should do it, right? I mean, there's no reason not to unless you love me.
 Do it.
 Wait.
Seriously? Seems like you've already made up your mind.
If you're that set on it, knock yourself out.
Only if I do it wrong.
Because as I mentioned before, it's very dangerous.
 Have fun.
 I'm serious.
I'm really gonna do it.
Great.
Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.
Morning time, Hollywoo.
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
And I'm An Actress Or Something, I don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.
 Whoa.
What happened to her?  She got kidnapped.
Oh, boy.
Oh, my.
Ooh, wow.
Oh, hey.
Look who survived to masturbate another day.
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.
If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go all out.
A big job like that needs lumber, and pulleys, lemons, so forth.
I'm not gonna halfass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.
Okay.
Well, I wish you all the best.
 Not too late to stop me.
 I'm not gonna stop you.
 Good 'cause don't.
 All right, we're in agreement.
Stop fighting! Can't you two see what this is doing to me? I've been acting out.
Have a great day.
Todd? Get in the car.
It's time to get serious about autoerotic asphyxiation.
Hooray! Question mark? Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.
Excuse me, I'm looking for something that will hold up a lot of weight.
Let's say something that could hoist up a horse comfortably by the neck.
Not for suicide purposes.
I'm trying to have a more fulfilling orgasm.
The world wept when news broke that J.
D.
Salinger died.
 J.
D.
Salinger died?  But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.
J.
D.
Salinger didn't die? As one of the 20th century's most celebrated authors, J.
D.
Salinger has inspired countless dreamers, eighth graders and occasionally, assassins.
His spare lyricism and devotion to character will undoubtedly translate into a penetrating dramatic work for this, the golden age of television writing.
J.
D.
Take it away.
I wanna do a show where people ask celebrities trivia questions.
 What?  Like a game show? Yeah.
You know because since they're famous people, I think normal people would wanna see if they know trivia and stuff.
You know, like, Hollywoo stars and celebrities, what do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out.
What a hoot.
I love it, and I don't use that word with just anybody.
What do you call it? I call it Hollywoo Stars and What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out.
It's maybe more of a working title.
I can see it on the marquee already.
 Must be a long marquee.
 It's long.
Yeah, yeah.
The celebrities can also do physical challenges.
Oh, it's perfect.
We've been searching for a companion for Hey, I Think You Can Dance.
But wait, wait one second.

Did you fix the bed? Yeah.,Humor
I was at the hardware store picking up supplies for my autoerotic asphyxiation machine.,Humor
"Because, as you are aware, I'm preparing to autoerotic asphyxiate myself.",Humor
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you could at least get a good night's sleep.,Humor

That doesn't sound like me.,Humor
I know.,Humor
"But if you love me, too, you won't do it.",Humor
I thought so.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
"Just for the record, I never really wanted to do this in the first place, Me not doing it is not a sign that I love you.",Humor
It's just because I'm a coward.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
I don't love you.,Humor

What is this, a crossover episode? That is the funniest thing I have ever heard.
Uncle Hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.
I used to watch Hank Hippopopalous's DancePop Cosmopolis every day after school.
 Hey, can I get a picture with you?  Of course, kid.
Here, let me advance this.
And we probably got it.
And we'll find out in four to six weeks.
Yeah, I can't wait.
Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared into that busboy's pants.
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.
Hey, kid, listen.
Don't beat yourself up too bad.
I've seen your show.
You're really funny.
 Yeah?  Yeah.
But I'm Uncle Hanky.
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.
That's just the way it is.
Oh.
This suit needs more flasks.
 Diane!  Aah! Will you bring me one of those big Toblerone bars? Well, sure.
But, you know, I won't be out there for another month.
Yes, I know, but I always forget to write these things down.
Tell me, how's your little movie? Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.
Oh, really? One person died? Just one? Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.
Meanwhile, Diane, here in Cordovia, I'm stitching children's arms back on.
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it? Are you giving me a thumb's up or a thumb's down? I can't tell.
Well, now the production's on hiatus so BoJack and I are going on a book tour to promote the new paperback edition of One Trick Pony.
Please get here soon, Diane.
The people of Cordovia need you and I need that Toblerone.
Okay, listen, you big dummy.
You need to be on your best behavior for this tour.
Don't do that BoJack thing where you go offscript and get a lot of people mad at you.
What? I don't do that.
You're a movie star now.
Any bad press you get can hurt Secretariat.
Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.
Please.
We're going to Alaska.
How am I gonna offend a bunch of inbred Eskimo blubbermunchers? You're right.
What was I thinking? The Republic of Cordovia's Prince Gustav visiting Los Angeles this week while his country rests on the brink of civil war.
Prince Gustav is a ruthless despot, but I'd still rather share a bed with him than my exwife.

Guys like us""? You think I'm a guy like us? Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life.",Humor
"Excuse me, would you get a picture of us? Yeah, that's kind of the idea.",Humor
Now we open the floor to questions from the audience.,Humor
"BoJack, your book talked a lot about how much you love apple fritters.",Humor
"Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.",Humor

"I mean, obviously there's no panacea, but a twostate solution with an emphasis on human rights feels like a place to begin.",Humor
Brilliant insight.,Humor
Very good.,Humor
My question is for Diane Nyu Nyu  Oh.,Humor
Nyu  You won't get it.,Humor
Ask the question.,Humor
Your book went to some revealing places.,Humor
Were you worried at all that it would hurt BoJack or his career? That's a great question.,Humor
"I'd also like to know the answer to that, Diane.",Humor
"Well, I think the truth is worth pursuing, no matter what.",Humor
BoJack's not perfect.,Humor
There are other celebrities who have done much worse things and it hasn't hurt their careers.,Humor
"Like who?  I don't know, like Mike Tyson or Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin, or Christian Slater, Woody Allen, Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray Wait, wait, what about Hank Hippopopalous? Well, all of his former assistants have made the same allegations.",Humor
I feel like we're getting off track.,Humor
"Do you not know that? Any questions about me, the handsome, famous horse with a book? What do you have against Uncle Hanky? I'm not saying anything not on the public record.",Humor
"You can just Google ""Hank Hippopopalous allegations"" and I Oh, you don't have to Google it right now.",Humor
Dear God.,Humor
Stanky Hanky? Allegations vile and ranky.,Humor
"But first, the visiting Cordovian Prince Gustav went missing briefly this afternoon, but he was quickly found buying chili in Beverly Hills.",Humor
"His official statement was, ""Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.",Humor
"Hooray, being a prince.",Humor
" Our main story, ominous and anomalous accusations against Hank Hippopopalous.
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen and what does she have against our beloved hippopotamus? Joining me now is Hippopopalous apologist and armchair sociologist, Cardigan Burke.
Cardigan, what are these allegations? These allegations are so crazy, I can't even say them on TV or I'll sound like a crazy person.
What I want to know is why we're letting a national treasure face the same kind of smear tactics used by the Viet Cong.
Are you calling attention to the fact that Ms.
Nguyen is Vietnamese? I'd like to think that's a coincidence.
You gotta see this set they're building! There's a giant replica of my head, and every episode, the eyes light up with dollar signs, confetti shoots out of the ears, then I somersault out the mouth.
We're bringing class back to primetime.
 Sounds amazing.
 And I'm really getting along with J.
D.
Salinger.
 Did you know we both hate phonies?  I did know that.
So listen.
Some website called Tit Puncher"" is saying you said some stuff about Hank Hippopopalous.",Humor
"Oh, my God, Mr.",Humor
"Peanutbutter, I didn't mean for that to happen.",Humor
"Hey, do me a favor.",Humor
Please don't make a big thing out of this.,Humor

There's that classic selfdeprecating Todd wit.,Humor
I'd know it anywhere.,Humor
We will now begin our Q and A.,Humor
Fire when ready.,Humor
"What you got against Uncle Hanky, you uppity cooze? Diane, I believe this question is for you.",Humor
"If anyone here has any questions about the book, I'd be happy to answer those.",Humor
"As would I, BoJack Horseman, GoldenGlobe winning star of the book.",Humor
"If Hank did anything wrong, they wouldn't let him on TV, right? I'm really not here to talk about that.",Humor
You women are all the same.,Humor
"Excuse me?  Yeah, you make these broad accusations to get attention for yourself, and when you don't have proof to back it up, you just slink away.",Humor
I'm not slinking away.,Humor
I just wanted to say one thing about me.,Humor
I text and drive like all the time.,Humor
"What? Isn't that what happened with all those assistants? They took his money, and they don't even care they could be ruining a man's life.",Humor
What? They ruined his life?  You should probably just drop this.,Humor
"Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.",Humor
They don't even know how much I'm gonna drop it.,Humor
The way you said that made it sound like you won't drop it.,Humor
How dare you spread a narrative that Don't tell me what to spread.,Humor
I'll spread whatever I want.,Humor
It's called one of the amendments.,Humor
"Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!  This is completely  Yeah, hi.",Humor
"I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.",Humor
I came with her.,Humor
"I gotta say I'm opposed to child labor, like as a rule, but there are some kinds of labor that children are just better at.",Humor
You ever try to fit into a mine shaft? That is a tight squeeze.,Humor
"What? Oh, man, probably gonna get some letters about that, huh? I'm so incorrigible.",Humor
"Everyone's paying attention to me now! Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.",Humor
Anyone else want a snack? No? That's a no? On the snacks? Okay.,Humor
What do you have against Hank Hippopopalous? Everyone says he's a really nice guy.,Humor
Good point.,Humor
That's exactly the problem.,Humor
"Because he's so nice, people don't wanna think he's capable of awful things so they let him off the hook.",Humor
We don't know what happened.,Humor
"It's a classic ""he said, she said.",Humor
" He said, they said.",Humor
" It's eight different women.
 Are they all lying?  I mean, probably.
We do that.
At this point, we just don't know enough to judge.
Who are these women? Have they ever shoplifted perhaps? Do they wear short shorts? Do they drink alcohol? All these things are possible.
We don't know the facts.
See, this is part of the problem.
You're supposed to be a journalist.
You won't even tell your audience what he's accused of.
You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us? I'm not afraid to say it.
Eight different women, all former assistants, claim that Uncle Hanky took them to a What is Diane doing? I know.
It's supposed to be my book tour and she's upstaging me.
Like how it was supposed to be my book.
Actually, this might be a thing she does.
She knows that Hippopopalous is the only thing keeping my network afloat, right? The same network that employs her husband.
Why would she do this? Sometimes she just whips herself into a frenzy and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?! Jesus, why does cantaloupe think every time it gets invited to a party, it can bring along its dumb friend honeydew? You don't get a plusone, cantaloupe! You need to talk to her.
Huh.
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit on Contemporary Family.
It's a disaster!  What?  The kids have gone through puberty.
They are rubbing themselves on everything.
If it isn't one thing, it's ano Just get a hose! Aha! I went to house to pick up mail for you like real American Johnny.
 Hey, man.
 Whoa! You know it's a federal crime to go through someone else's mail? I do not know your customs, for I am dirtpoor servant child.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.
Death threat for wife, death threat for wife, once more death threat, and here many monies off for Bed Bath Beyond.
Seems like great U.

How would she even fit one of those in there? Some sort of funnel.
Oh, I see, there's actually an illustration.
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man? This wife, she poke bear, yes? Yeah, I guess she kind of did.
They have a saying where I am from, which is here.
Bear not like to be poke.
 Bear get angry  Right.

Please don't ever change.
Okay, just kill the whole feature.
Replace it with Oh, I don't know.
What's Gwyneth doing for Purim? Diane? I want you to meet Amanda Hannity, editorinchief here at Manatee Fair.
The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.
That woman can knock a drink back like a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy, but damn if she doesn't get shit done.
No.
Yes.
Turtleneck.
You're fired.
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.
I would love to take down Hippopopalous and finally topple the acropolis of monstrous hypocrisy that ensconces us.
Hey, wouldn't your readers prefer something more relevant? Like, uh, what to do with all those extra buttons that come with your shirts.
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing your weight behind this.
 Oh, I didn't mean  That dress is hideous.
Go home, burn it and come back.
When we know what we know about a monster like that and we still put him on TV every week, we're teaching a generation of young boys and girls that a man's reputation is more important than the lives of the women he's ruined.
Yes, exactly! I feel like I've been alone in a crazy alternate universe these last few days.
Well, you know I got your back, right? We women have got to stick to Hey, fruit plate.
No, people don't want articles about that.
People want lifehacks.
Diane, you need to be strong.
Everyone is gunning for you.
You're a woman talking out of turn about a man.
We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.
No, this model doesn't look as pretty as the other one.
Can we kill it? Scarves, not just for necks anymo We need to sit you down with someone who's willing to go on the record.
I already reached out to all eight of Hank's former assistants.
Nothing.
 What about his current assistant?  You think she'd talk? I don't know.
What do you think, answering machine? Hi, my name's Nicole.
I work for Mr.
Hippopopalous and, um I really need to talk to someone.
Are you kidding me? With this honeydew right now? Ugh!  Nicole?  Mmhm.
Hello, Diane.
Thank you, Nicole.
Prince Gustav today startled the international community when he gave his royal fortune to charity.
What? Oh, no! And fired his chief advisor, who can be seen in this file photo looking vaguely suspicious.
Oh, you idiot! No! Big reforms which could lead to sweeping change in the embattled region, or a precipitous economic collapse.
But back to our main story, what is Diane's problem? I'll say it once, for your article.
I didn't do any of those things that you're accusing me of.
I wanna be very clear.
I'm not meeting you here because I'm scared of you.
This is me doing you a favor.
 I think you are scared of me.
 I'm not a bad guy, Diane, and I truly do believe that.
Twentyfour hours from now, the news cycle will move on to something else.
I'll go back to hosting my dance show, which employs hundreds of nice, good, hardworking people.
You, on the other hand, are pretty much done.
People love me and they're not gonna forgive you for this.
 This isn't about me.
 If you keep pushing this, you're gonna drag down the people close to you.
Look, you had your fun.
So, why don't you call it a day and go home to your husband? I know who you are.
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.
I'm Hank Hippopopalous.
Who the hell are you?  So, you got nothing.
 I'm not giving up.
There's gotta be someone who will talk.
Oh, listen.
I had a conversation with my bosses at AOLTime WarnerPepsico ViacomHalliburtonSkynet ToyotaTrader Joe's, and we agreed these kind of stories, they don't sell magazines.
 Are you seriously killing this?  It's just not a good time.
So, this has nothing to do with the fact that AOLTime WarnerPepsico ViacomHalliburtonSkynetToyota Trader Joe's also owns MBN, and is currently profiting off of Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation? I know you're upset.
Would you like a JoeJoe? It's just like an Oreo, but Trader Joe's style.
No, I don't want a JoeJoe.
Because you're mad at me, right? Not because JoeJoes taste like garbage? So, help me to understand Dog friend's program is to find what celebrities know?  Yep.
 So, is torture? We don't torture people in America, Todd.
That's called one of the amendments.
No, of course.
In America, you do not know to suffer.
You eat your cheesy pizza, you drink your Ade of gator.
This life is nice for visit but no way for live.
I go now.
Back to palace! Sounds great, Todd.
See you tomorrow.
So, they hated the skorts idea, huh? No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.
Hey, Diane! Why don't you shut your stupid ugly face?! Don't you talk to her like that! Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.
I say you should shut your stupid pretty face.
 This is not over.
When people hear what  Give it a rest.
It's over.
You lost.
 How could you say that?  What are you doing here? I mean, what is your endgame in all of this? You don't actually believe Hank's innocent, do you? Of course not, but that doesn't matter.
You're not gonna beat this guy.
I  What?  Todd? BoJack! Thank God you found me.
I thought I would never see you again.
 We're in the middle of something.
 I got mixed up in some bad stuff and a genocide may or may not have been perpetrated in my name.
Maybe you heard about it on the news? No, most of the news has been about Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.
What? Why? This is really serious.
Oh, of course your thing is serious and my thing is just a dumb feminist trying to get attention by attacking a famous man, is that it? Uh, what? No.
 Eat shit, Diane!  You eat shit! Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know what you're talking about.
He spent the last few days at Burning Man or whatever getting high.
No! That's not what happened at all.
A stranger just told me to eat shit.
I don't understand why you can't be on my side about this.
I am on your side.
And I'm telling you you're not gonna win this thing.
Also, P.
S.
, when have you ever been on my side?  I am always on your side.
 Really? Like when you wrote that book? Was that you being on my side? You're not still mad about the book.
You manipulated me and completely took advantage of Guys? There is a very fragile alliance between the Cords and the Ovians.
If we don't do something  Todd, nobody cares.
 Nobody cares, Todd.
Everything I did was to help you tell the story I knew you wanted to tell.
You got everything you wanted because of that book.
You were a joke, now people take you seriously.
You were out of work, now you got your dream role.
Okay, yes.
All of that is true.
But also, you were my friend and you hurt my feelings.
And it's weird that you never apologized for that and that you still won't.
Well I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
 Are you?  Yes, actually.
I am.
I didn't want to do that and I probably could have handled things better.
I definitely should have.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
But this is bigger than you and me.
And I need you in my corner now because I don't have anybody else.
Well, okay.
 Yeah?  Yeah.
I'm in your corner.

Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.
I'm obviously not making a difference here.
Actually, maybe you should.

And maybe some space might be good for us.
You don't really want me to go, do you? Why does it suddenly matter what I want? Flight 57, Cordovian Airlines, now boarding.
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it? No, I did not.
Well, that's good enough for me.

Hey, look at you, all dressed up for the Dipshit Awards.
You know you're not allowed in Hair and Makeup.

They're shoes with wheels, for efficiency purposes.
 Now I can be serious faster.
 You can also go nowhere faster.
Seeing as I am a professional No! Oh, BoJack.

What color comes from the combination of blue and yellow?"" I actually know this one.",Humor
"When I was growing up, my neighbor was a painter.",Humor
I remember visiting his flat and watching him work.,Humor
Sometimes he would mix together blue paint with yellow paint and it made an entirely new color.,Humor
And that man was Banksy.,Humor
And that color was green.,Humor
Final answer.,Humor
Correct! You've earned the chance to go for a spin in our KIA Sportage Cash Grab Booth.,Humor
"Oh, splendid.",Humor
"And while Daniel's in the booth, BoJack, you have an essay question.",Humor
What?  You'll find a blue book on your podium.,Humor
"To what extent was feudalism a cause of the French Revolution?  Wait, are you ser Oh!  And go! While BoJack works, let's check out the action on our KIA Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.",Humor
"Hey, champ.",Humor
What are you doing here? I'm trying to write an essay.,Humor
I came to ask you how you were doing and then to tell you you're not doing so well.,Humor
"Why am I getting the hard questions, while Boy Wizard over there just has to know colors and literally grab cash out of thin air? A five! This is so easy! I think I might be able to help you out.",Humor
Let me tell you a story.,Humor
"The year was 2003 and for some reason, everyone was playing poker all of a sudden.",Humor
A thenrelevant Wilmer Valderrama used to host a weekly howdoyoudo and all the stars came out to show off their tricks.,Humor

Peanutbutter.,Humor
Whoops.,Humor
Wohoh.,Humor
"I thought, ""Here's a rube.",Humor
" But Lady Luck had other plans.
You know what, I got an essay to write, so if this isn't about the precipitous fall of the French ruling class But then I saw, the kid had a tell.
I feel like that story had a lot of unnecessary details in it.
Listen.
You have to pay close attention, it's subtle, but when he gets excited, his ears ever so slightly flop up and give him away.
Well, that's no surprise.
Guy's been flopping upwards his whole career.
Mmhm.
Watch the ears.
Time's up, Daniel.
Whoa, looks like D to the R to the Ad to the Cliffe just won 54,000 bonus dollars.
And BoJack barely got beyond his thesis statement.
A continent ravaged by war, coupled with the retreat of the church from secular life"" And then it just stops? Oh, that's gonna cost you some serious pesos.",Humor
"But first, it's time for our Multiple Choice BuzzIn Round.",Humor
A buzzin round? All right.,Humor
In is my favorite direction in which to buzz.,Humor
"Tell me, ""How many oak trees are needed to build an 18th century tripleDecker Royal Navy battle ship? A, 75? B, 1000? Or C, 3500?"" C! 3500!  Um, correct.",Humor
"Uh, what? Uh, wow.",Humor

Which is an exciting surprise.,Humor
"Goddamn it, throw to commercial.",Humor
We'll be right back.,Humor
Hey.,Humor
Horshack.,Humor
What's going on?  What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.,Humor
"Yeah, you know, you're doing great, but I'm supposed to win.",Humor
That was the deal.,Humor
"Plug my movie, win money for charity.",Humor
"Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.",Humor
"By the way, your girlfriend has a stripper name.",Humor
"It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.",Humor
"BoJack, according to this app, you're almost tied.",Humor
"Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.",Humor
Congratulations.,Humor
Thanks.,Humor
"It was touch and go But I'm a little concerned because it seems like you might actually win, but everyone on the app is really rooting for Daniel.",Humor
People love him.,Humor
I guess he was in some movie about a potter or a Pottery Barn or something?  Are you asking me to throw the game?  You don't care about this game.,Humor
"The only reason you're here is for me, so maybe you could help me out?  Okay.",Humor
"You know what? You're the best, no matter what everybody on this app says.",Humor
They say you're the worst.,Humor
Especially Queefburglar69.,Humor
He's their leader.,Humor
And we're back.,Humor
"Contestants, I've got a history question for both of you.",Humor
"You may or may not be familiar with a famous racehorse named Secretariat.
In what year did Secretariat win the Triple Crown? BoJack.",Humor
Piece of cake.,Humor
"Hmm? Um, 1492? What? No, not even close.",Humor
"BoJack, aren't you in a movie about Secretariat?  How could you not know that?  Let's just move on.",Humor
"Maybe instead, he should be in a movie about a guy who doesn't know anything about Secretariat.",Humor
That would not be a good movie.,Humor
"I mean, more like Secreterrible.",Humor
"Damn, Bojangles, you got served.",Humor
"Do you know anything about Secretariat? You know he was a horse, right? Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you? No wonder my wife had to write your book for you.",Humor
"Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking about your wife, I've got a question.",Humor
How come your wife flew all the way to wartorn Cordovia just to get away from you? That's not what happened.,Humor
She went to help people.,Humor
Or maybe she went to help herself get away from her awful marriage.,Humor
"Oh, was that too far?  Ohho, you want to get into things?  Well, I mean  No, no, no, let's get into things.",Humor
Let's get real.,Humor
"Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.",Humor
Cancel the Bubble Round.,Humor
Because we're getting real.,Humor
"Should we cut to commercial? Would Homer cut away from Odysseus's journey just as he was being enticed by the sirens' song? No? Well, there you are.",Humor
Things are getting real out here.,Humor
Really real.,Humor
"Really, really, really real!  Uh, I'm not sure where you're going  Oh, no? You knew where you were going with my wife that time you pulled over by the side of the road.",Humor
"You know, a week before we got married?  Uh You want to talk about that, BoJack? You want to talk about the time when you, my ""good friend,"" kissed my wife?  No!  Yes.",Humor
"Did something exciting just happen? Because people on the app are, and I quote, ""losing their tits.",Humor
" Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to a cancer support message board.
Okay, how do I? How did you know about that? Well, there are roadside cameras all along the PCH, I have a few friends in the highway patrol, and she told me, of course! We're married! Wait, so you've known all this time? Now this is television.
Turn on the rain.
Um, don't you think you're pushing them too far? I'll tell you when it's too far.
This is my art, goddamn it.
I'm J.
goddamn D.
goddamn Salinger, and I want rain! All I ever wanted was to be your friend.
And you treat me like a big joke.
You think I don't notice? Why don't you like me?  Mr.
Peanutbutter  No, tell me.
 Because I'm jealous.
 Oh.
 Of what? Diane?  No.
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.
Oh, and it doesn't for you? You're a millionaire movie star with a girlfriend who loves you, acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want? What else could the universe possibly owe you? I want to feel good about myself.
The way you do.
And I don't know how.
I don't know if I can.
Whoa, guys, this is getting a little heavy, don't we think? I'm sorry, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Wow, um, I don't know if I can forgive you.
But I guess we'll find out right after this break.
 Damn.
 Shut up.
I knew it.
I knew this show would bring us to the heights of human drama more powerfully than literature ever dreamed.
Now somebody go out and get me a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.
On it.
It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.
Whoaoh!  Mr.
Peanutbutter!  Oh, hey Wanda.
I'm only half paying attention to whatever you two are arguing about but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.
I don't think we can just resolve everything cleanly in a halfhour.
Uh, this is network television.
So resolving everything cleanly in a halfhour is kind of what we do.
You want to host a game show where everyone feels bad at the end? You can get in your little car, drive to Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.
But these people want resolution, okay? So you get your little butt back on that stage and you resolve.
Uh And we're back.
You know, I did some thinking over the break.
BoJack  What's going on?  Oh, my God.
No! No! What's happening? Oh.
Someone unplugged the main power line and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.
Panini time.
Hey, who unplugged Todd! Goddamnit, step aside! Mia, good work.
You saved the show.
You earned my respect and this pen.
Oh, thank you.
Aww.
Oh, are we back? We're back! Live television, folks.
You know, during the break, my producers told me I had to forgive BoJack live on the air.
But I'm my own dog.
And as my own dog, I decided to forgive BoJack live on the air! Bring it in, buddy!  What?  Really? Mr.
Peanutbutter, I applaud your forgiving nature, but this guy kissed your wife.
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane? The only way to even the score is if you get to kiss him.
 Wait, what?  You're right, it makes perfect sense.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 No, it doesn't.
That way Diane and I will have had the same experience.
It's the only way we can move past this.
Well, if it helps us move past this, I guess Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Cue the Kiss Cam.
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam for Catcher In The Rye.
Well, just one more regret on a long list of many.
Todd, there you are.
You're missing a pretty big moment out there.
I don't care.
You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.
Not for nothing, but you were worthless before you didn't get the pen.
I really tried this time.
I guess I'll never really amount to anything.
Well, maybe you just need someone to believe in you.
Wow, no one's ever fallen for that!  What?  You're so stupid! You had the pen and you just gave it to me?! Oh, I can't believe that worked.
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.
The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't Yeah, said the girl who doesn't have a pen right now.
Unbelievable.
You are the most annoying, immature, aggravating, irritating, crazymaking Oh, she was mad, all right.
But kids? That's the story of how I met this pen.
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup and give me back my pen! I got your pen.
That means you respect me.
 No it does not.
 Viva Toddfoolery! Suck a dick, dumbshits.
Hey! Hey, hey! Well, that stern but supple kiss puts you over the top.
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.
Well played, Jockjam Doorslam.
You've earned $500,000 for charity.
You can walk away right now or, and remember, this is for charity, you can risk it all in our Double or Nothing round.
I wanna risk it all! All right.
Now that's $500,000.
If you get this question right, you double that, a million dollars for charity.
But if you get it wrong, the charity gets nothing and all the money will be set on fire live here on our studio soundstage.
BoJack, for all the marbles: Which famous actor played the titular role in the popular Harry Potter film franchise?""  Oh.",Humor
Huh.,Humor
Yeah.,Humor
I don't know.,Humor
"When you're as famous as I am, you meet so many people, it's impossible to remember them all.",Humor
"Okay, I get what you're doing.",Humor
Very funny.,Humor
Yeah.,Humor
"Oh, what is that guy's name? You know, it's on the tip of my tongue? Are you serious right now? Dude, this is for charity.",Humor
"BoJack, we need an answer.",Humor
"Yeah, I don't know.",Humor
"Gosh, I wanna say  Elijah Wood?  What? Elijah Wood?! Boxer versus raptor.",Humor

I can do whatever I want.,Humor
I'm president of the goddamn United States of America.,Humor
"Isn't that right, Checkers? That's what it says on your business cards.",Humor
There are going to be riots in the streets.,Humor
I'm Secretariat.,Humor
You think I'm afraid of a few rioting hippies? Don't make me laugh.,Humor
Hahoo.,Humor
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.,Humor
"Please, I'll do anything.",Humor
You gotta send someone else in my place.,Humor
Hmm.,Humor
Perhaps an arrangement can be arranged.,Humor
I'm just an athlete.,Humor
I'm no hero.,Humor
My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.,Humor
"He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam, which is necessary to protect our way of life.",Humor
And another hero is President Nixon.,Humor
He is one groovy dude.,Humor
Groovy.,Humor
"What the hell are you doing? Sorry, Mommy! Don't you dare put that out.",Humor
"That is a perfectly good cigarette, and you are going to finish it.",Humor
But I don't wanna.,Humor
And I don't want to be the mother of a quitter.,Humor
Finish it.,Humor
"Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke a cigarette right.",Humor
"Don't you dare cry, don't you ever cry.",Humor
You wanted this.,Humor
Are you punishing me for smoking or for stealing? I'm punishing you for being alive.,Humor
Ugh.,Humor
"Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw a lit cigarette off the Fine.",Humor
I'll call 911.,Humor
"The fire department got everything under control, but the cable's out for the neighborhood.",Humor
I don't understand what started the fire.,Humor
"Nobody knows where fires come from, it's a mystery.",Humor
"Anyway, I am fired up about my first day back on set.",Humor
We're gonna finish that big Nixon scene.,Humor
We were just one shot away before we went on hiatus.,Humor
"Yeah, I know.",Humor
You told me at breakfast.,Humor
"Why did you call me? Usually I talk to Diane on the way to work, but she abandoned me to teach piano in Cordovia or something.",Humor
Oh.,Humor
"Well, glad you settled for me because Diane wasn't available.",Humor
You bet.,Humor
"Oh, man, I'm gonna kill in this Nixon scene.",Humor
"BoJack gonna be in ""da"" house.",Humor
In da White House.,Humor
What happened to da house set? Da White House set?  Things changed a little.,Humor
You cut the Nixon scene? The Nixon scene is the core of the whole movie.,Humor
Where we see Secretariat be morally corrupted and get to look into the real darkness of his soul.,Humor
"It's still all that, except now it happens while you give a Christmas present to your nieces and they hug you while your butt is stuck in a chimney.",Humor
"Is one of the nieces Nixon? Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.",Humor
People don't want all that controversial stuff.,Humor
But we were supposed to make a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.,Humor
Warts and all.,Humor
"Kid, ""warts and all"" don't pay bubkes.",Humor
That's why they took the gay stuff out of A Beautiful Mind.,Humor
Know that guy who spent 12 years as a slave? They don't talk about the 60 years he spent as a jerk.,Humor
"Kelsey, you're okay with this?  Eh That's showbiz.",Humor
"See, BoJack, that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.",Humor
"Good shrugging, kid.",Humor
Yo! CaretotheOtotheLyntothe That's the end of your name.,Humor
We need to talk.,Humor
We'll meet in the supply closet in one minute.,Humor
"Break! Oh, okay.",Humor
"Ooh, ow.",Humor
"Carolyn, when you're in the throes of a very ugly divorce such as I am, along with all that pain and degradation comes a certain perfect clarity, and right now that clarity is telling me that you and I should get out of here.",Humor

What? But I can't just leave Vigor.,Humor
I've been here 20 years.,Humor
"Who's gonna water the plants? Um, I'm sorry.",Humor
"You water the plants? I started doing it as an intern, but then no one told me to stop, so it's still kind of my job.",Humor
"Carolyn, you are my gritty, witty city kitty.",Humor
"I want you with me, fiftyfifty.",Humor
Things are so crazy for me right now.,Humor
"I Don't give me that, you want crazy.",Humor
Crazy is your favorite Patsy Cline song and your second favorite Gnarls Barkley song.,Humor
I don't want crazy.,Humor
"I've got five episodes of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR, and I just want a night off to enjoy them.",Humor
"Well, if that's how you feel, I guess I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.",Humor
Gekko?!  But I'd rather look at you all day.,Humor
You're an amazing agent.,Humor
"And you're bright, and you're fun.",Humor
And I think we could make something really special.,Humor
We weren't doing anything! We were just looking for closet supplies.,Humor

"Okay, but you're the one in the janitor's closet, so What, I'm the idiot? The first thing you notice about Sebastian St.",Humor
Clair is that he speaks in paragraphs.,Humor
"Even I can't believe how much good we've done here, and I'll believe almost anything.",Humor
"In the last six weeks, we dug a new well, built a school, and next month the community center is doing Seussical.",Humor
There we go.,Humor
"In his previous life, Sebastian owned a chain of highend department stores.",Humor
I want to stock up on muffs.,Humor
We're going to sell a lot of muffs this winter.,Humor
"Huzzah! Diane, I lived a life of power and luxury, and then my picture was in the newspaper.",Humor
A reallife newspaper!  Uhhuh.,Humor
But I knew my life was empty.,Humor
At night I heard the cries of children sick and dying.,Humor
And I would scream into the night.,Humor
"Shut up! Shut up, children! But the phantom cries would not abate.",Humor
"And so I began my travels, with little more than a compass, a yearning for adventure, and several crates full of unsold muffs.",Humor
I knew there were people out there just waiting for my help.,Humor
"Diane, this is Kinko.",Humor
I am Kinko.,Humor
"In his language, it means, orphan whose parents were murdered by rebels and will die young, probably from malaria.",Humor
"Hi, Kinko.",Humor
I'm Diane.,Humor
"It means, my parents liked the show Cheers.",Humor
"Cheers! Oh, you're good.",Humor
You're very good.,Humor
When Sebastian St.,Humor
"Clair says you're good, you want to believe that you really are.",Humor
"That you, like Sebastian, are part of something bigger than just yourself.",Humor
"And for a moment, you feel like you are.",Humor
"Oh, Kinko made a mess.",Humor
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is way more valuable than a Triple Crown.,Humor
And cut.,Humor
Neat.,Humor
Let's break for lunch.,Humor
"Oh! Kelsey, this is a nightmare.",Humor
"I had to touch three children today, and one of them was sticky.",Humor
"Yeah, it was you.",Humor
"Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.",Humor
"BoJack, there's nothing we can do.",Humor
"No, this isn't you.",Humor
I've seen everything you've done.,Humor
"Your films are challenging and gritty, and they're great.",Humor
I'm not just saying that because they're full of lesbians.,Humor
"Look, even if I wanted to finish that Nixon scene, we don't have an Oval Office set.",Humor
There's one at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda.,Humor
"Why on earth do you know that? In season three of Horsin' Around, the horse got elected president and we shot on location.",Humor
"We can sneak into the library and get the shot, guerillastyle.",Humor
"Once Turteltaub sees it, he'll love it, and we can make the movie we both want to make.",Humor
"Okay, I'm in.",Humor
Let's do it.,Humor
All right! Did they really make your character president? Only for season three.,Humor
"In season four, it turned out it was all a dream.",Humor
They called my airplane Air Horse One.,Humor
And the vice president was a hiphop zebra named Zebro.,Humor
Come on.,Humor
It wasn't our best season.,Humor
"But on the bright side, was not our worst.",Humor
"Step one, we go to the Nixon Library and steal the scale model.",Humor
Welcome to my library.,Humor
I'm Nixon.,Humor
.,Humor
"Yeah, you know, some people say I look like Nixon.",Humor
Not because he's my dad or anything.,Humor
That's crazy.,Humor
Nixon's not my dad.,Humor
"But if you have any questions about Nixon, I'd be happy to answer them.",Humor
"Yeah, I have a question.",Humor
"Um Is that the lighted exit sign from Nixon's boyhood home? Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.",Humor
Is that  Here we go.,Humor
"the handicapped drinking fountain he used in the White House? No, just a normal drinking fountain.",Humor
Hang on.,Humor
One more.,Humor
Is that the smoke alarm?  No.,Humor
"So the Oval Office is right here, next to the men's room.",Humor
I remember because season three of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.,Humor
All the pressures of being president.,Humor
I don't see how we'll pull this off.,Humor
We're gonna need a crack team.,Humor
"First, we gotta get the best lockpick in the city.",Humor
Not interested.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
The second best lockpick in the city.,Humor
No way I'm doing that.,Humor
Got it.,Humor
A lockpick.,Humor
"Todd, can you pick locks?  Kind of.",Humor
Great.,Humor
You're in.,Humor
We'll need an expert cat burglar.,Humor
"All right, Good Wife, let's see what you got.",Humor
"Hey, Princess Carolyn! Kelsey and I are gonna break into the Nixon library to steal a shot for our Secretariat movie.",Humor
"It's a supersneaky, kooky caper that stands to benefit you in no way.",Humor
"Are you in? Hey! Shut up down there!  You shut up!  Make me! Hey, you got a problem? Take it up with my agent, your downstairs neighbor Princess Carolyn.",Humor
We'll need someone to play Checkers.,Humor
"Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.",Humor
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight.,Humor
Da Bears.,Humor
"BoJack, I'd love to help you out, but I'm superbusy recording promos for television's highestrated new game show.",Humor
We can probably do it without you.,Humor
This next one's for Seattle.,Humor
"Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.",Humor
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight.,Humor
Rain.,Humor
It's too bad though because I could really bring a lot to this project.,Humor
"The more I think about it, Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.",Humor
It's just a single on Secretariat.,Humor
"Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.",Humor
What does Ethan Hawke know?  We'll find out tonight.,Humor
So sorry.,Humor
You know what? Forget I even asked.,Humor
"Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
"Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.",Humor
"Character actress Margo Martindale, you've been a model prisoner.",Humor
I'm glad I served my time.,Humor
But now I'm ready to move on with my life and get back to doing small roles in criticallyacclaimed films and television shows.,Humor
"Watch, purse, lipstick, Emmy Award for Best Guest Actress.",Humor
I need your help with a breakin.,Humor
"BoJack, I've been out of prison for two minutes.",Humor
"What took you so long? Kelsey, Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter and I are gonna break into the library.,Humor
"But the problem is, the place is crawling with cops.",Humor
They're on high alert because some idiot stole this model last night.,Humor
"Yeah, nice work, Todd.",Humor
Who am I kidding? I can't stay mad at you.,Humor
You're adorable.,Humor
Look at your big saucer eyes.,Humor
I can go swimming in them!  Totally.,Humor
"Now, we need to lose the cops.",Humor
"The rest of you will create a diversion by breaking into the only other place in Yorba Linda of cultural significance: the Discount Fine Art Gallery in the strip mall, between the tanning salon and the adult bookstore.",Humor
"Once you set off the alarm, all the cops will go there.",Humor
"Now, things could get ugly.",Humor
One of you is very likely to die.,Humor
Possibly Alan.,Humor
"Why possibly Alan? Well, you are the guy none of us knows that well.",Humor
I just came to fix your cable.,Humor
"Alan, you already know too much.",Humor
"You're a part of this now, like it or not.",Humor
"But  Hey, you think you could keep it down? I'm reading a script and I'm having trouble focusing, so now my notes are gonna be confusing and vague.",Humor
We're almost done.,Humor
"I know you're having fun with your police cars, I just wish you would have asked before you invited these people over.",Humor
"I live here, too.",Humor
You're right.,Humor
I'm sorry.,Humor
And can you at least let Alan fix the cable before he dies? I can't die.,Humor
"I'm endangered! ""And the truffleinfused gnocchi was the star dish at this upandcomer that will please the pickiest of Brooklynites and the less discerning Staten Islander.",Humor
" When I grow up, I can be food critic for New Yorker? You can do anything you want in life.
Not everyone can write for The New Yorker, but there's always The Atlantic.

Remember, you're supposed to be writing about me.
Sure, but isn't this why we're here? To help these people? I'm here to help these people.
You're here to help me help them by writing a book about me so people back home will give money to my foundation.
Great.
Okay, come on.
Over here.
Get it.
We're in.
It's too late to turn back now.
One of us isn't going to come out of this alive.
Why do you all keep saying that? Why can't we all assume we're gonna make it out alive and go from there? Alan, we've got enough problems without worrying about your imminent death.
Can't we just all shut up and do this? Why does everything have to be a big, complicated mess? Like, look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.
It's simple.
And serene.
And pleasant.
I think that the vest makes me look kind of chunky.
I don't do CrossFit five days a week to not look sweet in this uniform.
I swear to God, if you don't shut up about CrossFit Breakin at the Discount Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.
Let's roll! That's a thing we say at CrossFit.
Remember when my character on Mr.
Peanutbutter's House was  elected president?  Let me guess, it was all a dream? No, I served half a term, then resigned because when Zachary had a bad time with peer pressure, I realized I was spending too much time being president and not enough time being a dad.
It's like you didn't even watch my show.
Okay, I'd like you here.
And then you are going to be over here.
 Freeze!  I'm union.
 Playing dead.
 Breaking and entering? That is against everything Nixon stood for.
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.
Yeah? What, another leftist screed about how corrupt he was?  Uh  Or is it about how he had an illegitimate son, and the son never knew who his dad was, but always had a hunch it was Nixon, and then that son grew up to be the security guard at the Nixon Library? The second one? Well, if that's true, how come you don't have an actor here to play Nixon? Because we couldn't find anyone who could appropriately capture his magic.
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.
You? No way.
Hello, I'm Nixon.
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am your father and I love you very much.
Oh, my God.
He's perfect.
We've found our Nixon.
I can be ready in five.
Uh.
Did we get the shot? It's so peaceful.
 Okay, folks.
 Aah! Party's over.
That's something we say at CrossFit.
Ugh.
Wait a sec I know you! You were in Justified.
You were amazing.
Okay, you caught me.
I am kind of a wellknown character actress.
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh What? What's your name? Sure, of course.
Everyone loves my work, but apparently not enough to watch the credits and find out what my name is.
The important thing is that we enjoy your great performances, right?  How about you enjoy this? Aah!  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.
Oh, is that what we agreed to? I thought we said no gum.",Humor
" But you're also chewing gum.
I'm a wild card.
 Aah!  Return fire! Watch out! Oh, no! Alan's dead! No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead! Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad! See you later! Die, you chunky assholes! See, Jeff? This is what I'm talking about.

"If I call the police, will I get a line?  No, we won't use it in the movie.",Humor
We only need the oneshot of me.,Humor

Give me a suggestion.,Humor
Uh I don't know.,Humor
"Suggestions? Your suggestion was ""suggestions.",Humor
"  Way to break the fourth wall.
 That wasn't that funny.
My name's Bryan and you haven't won me over yet.
 Oh, Bryan.
 Todd, in improv, we get suggestions from an audience then make up scenes based on them.
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions.
You don't say no.
No matter what.
When someone makes a suggestion, you always try to build on it.
We call that yes, and"" Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.",Humor
It's all part of the fun.,Humor
Is it really that simple? Ugh! It's incredibly complicated and requires years of training.,Humor
"Oh, Bryan.",Humor
But improv isn't just about a constant clamoring for attention and validation.,Humor
It's about community.,Humor
I've always wanted to be part of a community.,Humor

Your first class is $200.,Humor
I thought you said it was free.,Humor

It's Copernicus.,Humor
"Who's that?  What are you, new? Yes, I am new.",Humor
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.,Humor
That guy is the JanOve Waldner of modern improv.,Humor
Who is JanOve Waldner?  The Michael Jordan of table tennis.,Humor
Oh.,Humor
Let's go talk to him.,Humor
Are you kidding? You can't just go up and talk to Copernicus.,Humor

 Oh, I love plays.
 A play.
That's my favorite place to eat crinkly candies.
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work on something good, you know? Oh? Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot, even though the movie's gonna be a piece of shit, right?  What?  Oh, you said piece of ship,"" right? Like shipshape? Anyway, what were we talking about? Who knows?  Okay, moving on.",Humor
"Hey, it's fine.",Humor
Abe knows what we're making.,Humor
"Right?  Wanda, would you help me with dessert?  Uh, okay.",Humor
Yeah.,Humor
"New York is so great in the summer, but I don't think we're going to be done in time.",Humor
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.,Humor
"Are you kidding?  Well, you know, because the movie's such a piece of shit and all.",Humor
"Did that hurt your feelings? I mean, you're the one who said we're not making Casablanca.",Humor
"Right, because Casablanca is a movie about a club owner named Rick.",Humor
"This movie's about Secretariat, a racehorse.",Humor
"Wait, you literally meant we're not making the actual movie Casablanca? That movie already exists.",Humor
Why would we make Casablanca?  This is a different movie.,Humor
I think there was a misunderstanding.,Humor
"Wrong, boyo.",Humor
There was a misterunderstanding.,Humor
And that mister is me understanding you just fine.,Humor
You come into my home and you call my work shit?  You know what I think? You're shit.,Humor
What? You think I don't get enough takes? I'll get more takes.,Humor
"Just wait, see how many takes I can get.",Humor
"Well, don't go.",Humor
We haven't had dessert yet.,Humor
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.,Humor
"I mean, it's no banana cream pie.",Humor
Because it's a different kind of pie? That's right.,Humor
Why did you have to antagonize him? I wasn't trying to antagonize him.,Humor
"He said, ""It's no Casablanca.",Humor
"  Well, what's done is done.
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.
Lucky me, I get to stay here and work on this movie that's gonna ruin my career.
There's no reason to sulk about it, right? Or you could sulk about it.
Diane does raise some good points.
No, she doesn't.
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person you wanna be going to for life advice now.
Why? Just because I've been drinking myself to sleep on your deck chairs and lying to my husband for the last week? Hey, there's a CheezIt on the shelf.
I knew I kept these things around for a reason.
 I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
 No one cares, Todd.
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice? Make a suggestion.
 Stop.
 Aah.
Sorry, officer, I didn't see that stop sign.
Yes.
And my car runs on farts.
Ugh!  Stop.
No, stop it.
 Please stop.
Not a suggestion.
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.
I want to become a Level Two, so I can finally achieve clarity on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.
What? No, improv is not a cult.
It's just a dogmatic school of thought taught by a forprofit organization with the promise of social and professional opportunities.
 Ahh.
 It's a cult.
And I know.
I learned a little about cults during that year I was a Scientologist.
Coincidentally during that year, I read a book about cults.
Wait, are you saying Scientology is a cult? No, Scientology is not a cult.
Improv is a cult.
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.
 I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
 Why does anything matter, right? Love is an illusion, and happiness is fleeting, no such thing as God, and all your favorite musicians beat their wives.
Allegedly.
Would you talk to her? Yes.
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.
Heyyy Hitler.
Please stop.
President Lohan! Get away from that fire hose! Fire hose! Sorry I'm late, guys! Todd, we take tardiness seriously here at Shenanigags.
 If you miss one more class, you're out.
 I'm sorry.
But, wait, Bryan isn't here.
 He's later than I am.
 Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought he could benefit from some time away.
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.
 Is that a reward or a punishment?  That's up to Bryan.
Let's have no more questions about the Giggleship.
Oh, uh, all right.
Well, you know, I was actually talking to my best friend, and he said improv is a cult.
I mean, that's crazy, right? If you think Shenanigags is a cult, you're free to go, Todd.
Oh, no.
I don't wanna go.
I love this place.
My friend just doesn't know how great you guys are.
It sounds like your friend's not yesand'ing you.
Invite him to your graduation show.
If he's too negative to support you, you should take a good hard think about if that's the kind of energy you want in your life.
I hate good hard thinks.
I love you, too, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
But I I gotta go.
I'm Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.
The kids get jealous if I'm talking on the phone.
Uh, okay, bye.
So, hey, hi.
How long are you thinking of staying here? Just for my own reference.
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me? No one is making me do anything.
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.
Well, yeah.
I really thought I could do it.
I thought I could go far away and help people and be this best possible version of myself.
And what happened? I couldn't.
I wasn't the person I thought I was.
I'd love to stay and wallow with you, but I gotta head out.
Today we're filming what used to be the scene where Secretariat commits suicide, but is now a scene where he swims in a fishing hole  with his girlfriend Susie Side.",Humor
"  Yeesh.
If you wanna blow off work, I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch, drink beer, and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around.
Hmm.
And if I hear one more peep out of you  Sabrina!  What? I didn't peep! Oh! Sabrina was such a little bitch.
She was an orphan.
She had a tough life.
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.
Did you go to work today? I was gonna, but then I remembered everything is garbage, so why bother doing anything?  True story.
 Okay.
Oh, you didn't.
Oh, you did.
 Hello.
 Hey, could you get the door?  Whoa.
 Mm.
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months to get everything we need out of this place.

Katie's lawyers are watching me closely right now.
They're hawks.
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.
Rutabaga, this is too This is a temporary technicality, I promise.
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.

 Look at this urn.
What's going on in here? Mr.
Peanutbutter, shut the door.
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency, and we want you to come with us.
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.
Are you in or out? Are you kidding? You're the agent who got me Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.
 Well  What do they know?  Right, so  Do they know things?  Okay  Let's find out.
 Right  Big fan.
I like you guys.
I like your hustle and I like your matching lipstick.
 Well, um  I am in.
Mmhm.
Go home, Goober.
Yeah! Go home, Goober! Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home? Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.
 You suck, Goober!  Hey, Goober! Get murdered! Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.
 Hey, guys.
 Shut up, Todd.
BoJack, listen, I Oh!  Hey, whoa!  Boo! Party foul!  You knocked over Buckingcan Palace.
 Come on! Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.
Listen to this guy, clean it up later.",Humor
" Hasn't picked up his shit in years.
Clean up your shit, Todd.
BoJack, I wanted to invite you to my graduation show tomorrow night.
 What?  Look, I know you think it's just a dumb cult, but you're my best friend and it would really mean a lot if you came.
I'm gonna go down to the basement to practice my space work.
And here I am going downstairs.
Hello?  What kind of pants are you wearing now?  What? I don't know.
The normal kind.
Yeah? Mm.
Are they comfy? A comfy pair of pants? I guess.
Why? Just wondering what kind of hit you're gonna take when the studio sues the pants off you for breach of contract.
They're suing me? Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes? Because that was a long road to walk to get to that punch line.
 This is serious.
 We're not just doing bits? You started it with the pants thing.
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.
Remember, you wanted this.
Are you saying you're finally ready to settle down with yours truly? Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse, but I'm tired of running in circles.
Cut! Perfect.
But let's get that last part again.
 Anything you want me to do differently?  No, I just think we should get it again.
You know, for safety.
 Action!  I'm tired of running in circles.
And again? I'm tired of running in circles.
Why don't we get it like five more times? I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
Let's get it ten more times.
 Tada!  We did it.
 What now?  We die, have our guts ripped out through our noses, and get enshrined inside of it.
Duh.
Hey, BoJack, can I talk to you for a minute? Ooh Alone, please? Oh So, good news.
We're gonna go on a trip.
 Right now.
You and me.
 What? I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.
Where? Why? Less asking, more basking.
In the sun, that is.
Santa Barbara.
 I'm not really in the mood for  I think some time away could be really good for us, as a couple.
Oh.
I know you've been really bummed out about the movie, but I don't think moping around the house with Diane all day is healthy.
All I've ever wanted was to be in this movie, and you just want me to put on a happy face Yes.
There are lots of people who don't like their jobs.
Doesn't mean they have to bring it home with  Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
 What is that supposed to mean? Well, come on.
You're a network executive.
You don't give a shit about work.
I actually have a lot of pride in what I do.
What? You have a lot of pride? Your job is to pump out garbage every year hoping some of the garbage stinks less than the rest so you can quietly renew that garbage and keep failing sideways until you retire to a threepointfive bedroom garbage in Beverly Garbage and spend the rest of your life  watching your former assistant's garbage.
 I don't know where this is coming from.
Every good thing that ever happened to you happened because of network executives like me.
That show you spend all day watching, your house, your career Great house, great career, great life! Must be why I'm so happy all the time!  You don't know  I don't? My life was ruined by a network executive like you.
Well, I'm sorry that things have been so hard for you, but that doesn't give you the right to be shitty to me.
I can't be around someone who's just fueled by bitterness and negativity.
Well then, what are you doing here? What happened, BoJack? Same thing that always happens.
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.
And now you know me.
You know, it's funny.
When you look at someone through rosecolored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.
 So, Wanda's moving out.
 Oh, shit.
Because of me? No.
Because of me.
I'm sorry.
You wanna watch another episode of Horsin' Around? Where Olivia does the school project where she pretends an egg is a baby.
Spoiler alert: Ethan needs to make an omelet.
Why won't you go home? I should.
I know I should.
I wish I could just go home right now and crawl into bed and not have to talk about anything or explain anything.

" And I wouldn't have to say, I'm sorry I left.",Humor

Can I ask you something? That play in New York, would that really have made you happy? Yeah.
I mean, for a little bit.
And if Kelsey didn't get fired, and you got to make the movie you wanted to make, would that have made you happy? For a little bit.
But then Probably So, what does it matter? But there has to be more.
Well, when's the last time you were actually happy? You microchipped my penis? Check, please! Microchip.
Ah.
Oh.
Todd! Yeah.
Oh.
Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Hey.
How are you? I can't do this anymore.
You can't do what anymore? I can't talk to you on the phone all the time.
It's too hard.
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth? I think maybe we should stop calling each other, for a little bit.
I'm sorry.
I just miss you too much.
But listen, I love you.
Okay? Mr.
Peanutbutter? Uh, yeah.
Uh, okay.
I love you, Diane.
 Where is he?  I don't know, sir.
Can't do this to me.
Where the hell is he? Boxer versus raptor.
Nananananananana.

What are you doing here? You said if I was in town to give you a call.
 Wanna get a drink?  It's eight in the morning.
It's 5:00 p.
m.
in Los Angeles.
 That's not true.
 I don't know what time it is.
When's the last time you slept? You look like shit.
Really? 'Cause you look like a million  Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
 What about the store? What if somebody has an emergency and they need more turquoise shit? It's New Mexico.
They'll find it.
 It's really good to see you.
 It's good to see you, too.
I can't wait for you to meet Kyle and the kids.
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me that's the name of your band.
So, who are you again? You were friends with Mom when she lived in L.
A.
? Your mom never mentioned she used to hang out with the BoJack Horseman? Star of screen and book?  Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles?  Never came up?  All these years?  It was a long time ago.
Oh, gross.
Mom, Trip has a boner again.
 Trip.
 Trip, let's dial back the boners.
 Gross.
 What? I can't help it.
 Trip, ew.
 You are at the breakfast table with your parents, your big sister, and an old man.
 What could possibly be arousing you?  Am I the old man? I don't understand how it works.
I was just excited that I finished the maze on the back of the cereal box.
So, BoJack.
What brings you to Tesuque? So, we're just gonna change the subject and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv right now? Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.
Charlotte told me if I was ever in New Mexico  I should call her.
 But what are you doing in New Mexico?  Yeah, what are you doing in New Mexico?  I, uh You didn't drive all this way just to see my mom, did you? No, of course not.
That would be crazy, to come all this way just to see a woman I haven't had a real conversation with in 30 years.
 I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
 Uh  Because she has a family, which is great.
 Yeah.
 You guys are great.
 Yeah.
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.
 Mm.
 On my way to see  On your way to sea?  Yes.
To the sea.
To the shining sea.
Because I'm here to buy a boat.
 At the Santa Fe Boat Show.
 I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.
That's 'cause it's a secret boat show.
 Invitationonly.
 Huh.
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries and bigtime celebrities and kings.
 Wow.
 Hold up.
If you live in Los Angeles, which is right on the ocean, why would you drive all the way here to go to a boat show  in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?  Jeez, so many questions.
What is this, Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities, What Do They Know, Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out? Oh, gotta take this.
It's my boat guy.
 Hello?  Okay, so I got Turtel Hey, Knute.
 You got any leads for me, boatwise?  What? Sounds perfect, Knute.
 Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?  Huh?  Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
 BoJack In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that.
What's going on?  Where the hell are you?  Tesuque.
 Tewhoka?  Tesuque, New Mexico.
 Outside Santa Fe.
 Are you testupid? If you don't get your ass back teset, you're gonna get tesued.
 Just get me a couple of days.
 For what? What are you doing there? I don't know, I just This isn't what I expected.
Well, I can probably stave them off till Monday if you get pinkeye.
 Can you get pinkeye?  I have to go.
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back? Soon.
Yep, I want the starboard  to be fully starboard.
 What?  And the port to be also starboard.
 Huh?  Thanks a lot.
Goodbye.
 Wait, BoJack  Hey.
 I'm really glad you're here.
Oh, yeah uh, me, too.
I hope this isn't weird for you.
You know, me having a family and Why would it be weird? At our age, it's weird if you don't have a family.
 I mean  Well, not for you.
 No.
 'Cause you've been busy.
 Right.
 With your career.
Sure, yeah, my career has kept me super busy.
Anyway, I know you're just in town for the boat show, but seriously make yourself at home.
I really don't want to impose.
If there's anything I can do to help around here Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving after school today, but now he's gotta take Trip to his dumbass basketball game.
 It's the quarterfinals.
 You'll just get a hardon in the game.
Now I will get a hardon because you made me think about it.
Thanks a lot.
 I'll take you driving this weekend.
 I need to practice every day.
I'm the only senior who still doesn't have a license.
It's embarrassing.
Well, I got the store, and I already took the morning off, so unless you know any other adults Can BoJack take me?  Huh?  What?  I mean, he is an adult.
 Uh Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.
Well, I guess I could make some time before the boat show.
Keep your eyes on the road, both hands on the wheel.
 Okay.
 And don't text and drive, unless it's an emergency, like you have a really funny thing that you just have to text someone.
 Got it.
 So, let me ask you something.
Tsk.
Do your parents really love each other, or is it a staytogetherforthekids situation? What? Why would you ask me that? I don't know.
Just making conversation.
 Why do we keep passing the same house?  No, I don't.
Shut up.
You shut up.
What's the story? Cute guy live there? Girl you hate? College kid that gives you Adderall? Okay, fine.
That's Diego Mendoza's house.
He's just this stupid guy.
He's in my calculus class, and sometimes we'll do this thing where he goes, Hey,"" and then I go, ""Hey.",Humor
" Then he goes, What's the homework?"" and I tell him.",Humor
"It's not like a big deal or anything, but it's like this thing we do.",Humor
Cool thing.,Humor
"So, anyway My best friend, Alison F.",Humor
was talking to Rachel Kaplan.,Humor
"Do I really need to know these names? Rachel heard from RayRay and the Bean that Diego said if prom happened right now he'd want to go with Ali Sandler, and I'm like, ""Yeah, pfft, okay, dude.",Humor
" You know what I mean? You know I don't know any of these people, right? But then he said since prom's not for another two months, he could foresee a situation"" where he would want to go with me, because he knows I'm a real girl who's mostly chill.",Humor
"If you're so mostly chill, why do you keep driving by his house? In case he comes out, to, like, check the mail or something.",Humor
"I'll get out of the car and be like, ""That's so funny.",Humor
I was just going for a drive.,Humor
" And he'll be like, Oh, hey.",Humor
" And I'll be like, Hey.",Humor
"  'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
 That's the whole plan? Well, it's better than your plan for buying a boat in New Mexico.
Dude, what are you really doing here? I didn't like the person I was in L.
A.
And I didn't know where else to go.
 Please do not tell your parents.
 Well, I won't, but I think people are gonna notice if you go to a boat show and don't come back with a boat.
Oh, my God, there he is.
Get down!  Oh, my God.
Oh!  What are you doing?  What happened to your plan?  Oh! I panicked.
I didn't know he'd be wearing a tank top.
 Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
 Yeah, deal.
 They didn't even put me in.
 I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You did some great cheering from the bench, and for someone who never plays, you sweat a lot.
 Maybe they'll put me in next game.
 Sure, they will.
No way they'll do that.
 What the?  Huh?  Whoa!  Whoa! What a boat.
 Can I go on your boat?  I don't see what's stopping you.
Yeah! Woohoo! I'm going on a boat! I got my way! Where's your car? I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?  Uh well  Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.
On a boat! Think of the amount of floating! Please stay out of the bedroom.
 Does she have a name?  Who?  The boat? It does not.
 Come on.
You gotta give her a name.
You should call her the Escape From L.
A.
That actually is a good name for it, the nongendered object.
Oh, she's a good girl.
I can tell, she's a good girl, isn't she?  Or are you a bad girl?  Are you flirting with my boat right now? No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.
 Mind if I get on top of her?  Knock yourself out.
Dad, don't be gross.
 Wow, you really got a boat.
 Yeah, sure did.
So, does that mean you're leaving? Oh, I, uh Yeah, I guess, uh I guess I did do what I came here to do.
You don't have to go right away, right? At least stay till the end of the weekend.
 Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
 Oh, it's no bother.
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides heh, everyone here loves you.
Uh, everyone? Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.
 Too late.
 Seriously, stay as long as you want.
 What?  BoJack, great news.
Do you still want to go to New York? Because Jill Pill Jill Pill? I don't care about this.
Okay, moving on.
Do you remember when we were at Herb's funeral  and you told me?  Whatever it is, I don't care.
Oh, there's a kitchen! Can we make pizza bagels? Yeah, family dinner on the boat.
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back on set Monday.
What? How long do I have to keep putting out fires for you? I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.
 What?  I think I might be here a while.
Listen, I Well, who's getting seasick? Just kidding.
It's such an eyesore.
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely, they'll move the boat.
BoJack?  Yeah?  Supper's ready.
So, I had another meeting today with the Drama Chair at SFCC.
They're gonna offer me a position.
 What? That's amazing.
 Oh, that's cool.
Congratulations.
There's a real stickinthemud dean there who doesn't like my inyourface style.
If I know me, it might lead to some pretty zany misadventures.
Mm.
Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.
It's funny you brought up the Brussels sprouts, because I think they're terrible.
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.
Penny, did you hear my bit about the Brussels sprouts? A bit is what they call a joke in show business.
 Right, BoJack?  That's right.
String a bunch of those together and you got yourself a riff.
You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.
Okay I think someone's in a mood.
Oh, my God.
I'm not in a mood.
Whatever.
Get bent.
I hate my life.
I can't wait to be dead.
I'll talk to her.
Everyone said for months  that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
 Yeah?  But he keeps not doing it.
 That is so typical Diego.
So, I thought, okay, if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.
 Way to take initiative.
 Oh.
Rookie mistake.
So, I asked him and he said no.
And then this other girl, Lyla K.
, came up to him and was just like, Hey.",Humor
" And he was like, Hey.",Humor
" And that's our thing.
Well, I don't want to tell tales out of school, but this Lyla K.
character sounds like a real bustass superskank.
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice to not have a date,  because you can actually  Mom.
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school  and you'd go to your sock hops.
 Do you think  I went to high school in the '50s?  Penny, hey, I got an idea.
 You should take me to the prom.
 Huh? Everybody loves having BoJack around.
What? Why? Think about it.
If you went with Diego, you'd be nervous.
Does he like me? Am I cool?"" But with me you can just relax and enjoy yourself.",Humor
"Diego will see you have a good time without him, and that'll make him super jealous.",Humor
"So, he'll come up to you, and he'll say, ""Hey.",Humor
" And then you say, Hey.",Humor
"  Oh, that's so cold.
 Right?  Wait  Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.
 How is that cold?  Then he'll say, Wanna dance?"" And you'll say, ""I'm busy right now.",Humor
Maybe later.,Humor
" And then never dance with him.
 That'll show him.
 Wait I'm sorry.
 Don't you want to dance with Diego?  Stop poking holes, Charlotte.
 This is a great plan.
 Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom! Oh, yeah, well, that's definitely the better idea.
Okay, everyone smile.
Real big.
 Cheese.
 I think we have enough pictures.
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.
Taking pictures before prom is so bourgeois.
And who are you again?  I'm Maddy.
 Maddy's my best friend.
 I thought Alison F.
was your best friend.
 That was like three best friends ago.
You were best friends with Alison F.
?  No.
 Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.
But they call me Pete Repeat because I always say everything twice.
 Everything?  Yeah, it's kind of my thing.
 Okay.
 Ah, damn.
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I? Usually I do it.
Cool.
Wow, RayRay and the Bean are already posting pics on Instagram.
 What?  Hashtag much? Let me see.
Whoa, hold on.
Responsible adult.
 What are you drinking?  Nothing.
 Hand it over.
 Fine.
Ugh.
Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12? You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.
Do they teach you anything in school? Make a left at the light.
 Where are we going?  I'll get you some bourbon.
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.
Wait, really? If you're gonna drink, you should be smart about it.
Awesome.
Wait.
How many times did I just say awesome""? Was it twice or was it once? Ah, it was probably twice.",Humor
"Yeah, it's twice.",Humor
Pete Repeat.,Humor
Ugh.,Humor
It burns.,Humor
"Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.",Humor
"You want some?  No, thanks.",Humor

She's got nothing on you.,Humor
Why is nobody dancing? We gotta get this party started.,Humor
"Beat it, Poindexter.",Humor
Poindexter?  It's a nerd reference  Just beat it.,Humor
"Ah! Huh?  Hey!  What's the big idea? Why is there an adult at our high school prom? All right, folks.",Humor

All right.,Humor
I'm listening.,Humor
"As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.",Humor
"Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat, and here we go.",Humor
Waka waka.,Humor
"Now boys and girls, if you wanna do the BoJack,  take your hands and put them on your  Boo!  This sucks.",Humor
This guy's bad.,Humor
"God, no! This is not the immediate praise I expected.",Humor
This prom sucks.,Humor
You can say that again.,Humor
I know.,Humor
My flask got empty.,Humor
"Can we be back to the car, so, for more get for put in it? Or we could go back to the car and just leave.",Humor
You can't just leave the prom.,Humor
Of course you can.,Humor
You're young.,Humor
You can do whatever you want.,Humor
That's what they never tell you until it's too late.,Humor
You don't have to be here.,Humor
"Yeah, is right.",Humor
Society is everywhere.,Humor
Society.,Humor
"Well, what else are we gonna do? I'd say it's time to get down, time to hit the town.",Humor

"Maddy, come on.",Humor
"No, look, my cousin had a friend who passed out like this, and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.",Humor
"I really think we should get Maddy to a hospital, to a hospital.",Humor

Penny and I are gonna take off.,Humor
What? You don't want too many people around in a hospital setting.,Humor
"If anyone asks, tell them we left the dance early, and you don't know where Maddy got the whiskey.",Humor
"Why? It's one thing if a bunch of kids get drunk on prom night, but if there's an adult there, I was supposed to be responsible, and then the whole thing feels kind of creepy.",Humor
"Are you sure she's gonna be okay?  I don't know, BoJack.",Humor
Pete.,Humor
"I'm the adult here, and I need you to listen to me.",Humor

 Let's get out of here right now.
 No, BoJack.
You and me, this is real.
 You know this is real.
 My husband is right upstairs.
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.
 Don't do this, BoJack.
 I know you feel it, too.
So many times in my life I've done the wrong thing, but this is the right thing, and I have never been more sure of anything.
I've wasted so much time sitting on my hands and imagining what could have been.
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.
 I think you should go.
 Okay.
 Tomorrow.
 Charlotte I have worked very hard to build this life for myself.
I am happy here.
And you just roll into my life like a hurricane.
Why? Because we knew each other for five minutes 30 years ago?  I don't know you.
 You do.
I don't.
And you don't know me.
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.
 I love you, your family and this town.
 Stop.
 I never wanted to hurt  BoJack I'm sorry I kissed you.
I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.
 Everything can go back to normal, but  No, no, stop.
No.
Please, don't make me go back to L.
A.
I don't care where you go, BoJack, but I can't have you around here.
You make me too sad.
Okay.
What are you doing here? I know what I want, BoJack.
Go to bed, Penny.
Wait, what? Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
 No.
 Mom.
 Charlotte.
 Penny, go to your room.
 We didn't even do anything.
 Now, Penny.
 Charlotte, I am so sorry  Don't.
Don't you dare.
If you are not out of my driveway in 30 minutes, I will call the police.
And if you ever try to contact me or my family again, I will fucking kill you.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here? Yep, still here.
Boxer versus raptor.
Nananananananana.

Look alive, bright eyes.
It's the morning and somebody loves you.
Right back at you, buddy.
 Oh, my God.
He's here.
 There he is.
 I love you, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
 I love you, too.
Idea for a new Pixar movie: what are pizza boxes thinking about?  And Leland Stanford?  Transcontinental Railroad.
 Transcontinental Railroad?  That is correct.
Next question, what is my favorite kind of berry?  Barry Bostwick.
 Raspberry? I'm so sorry, the correct answer, of course, was Barry Bostwick.
 How was I supposed to know?  He also likes Franken Berry.
 We would have accepted Franken Berry.
 What?  I'm sorry, you lose.
 What the? That's our show, but before we go I wanna send out a quick message.
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you and I know you're doing great things.
Idea for a new app: an undo button that could undo long amounts of time.
 Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!  Three months.
A year.
A life.
Erica, where did that tooth come from? All right, let's keep this party going.
One click and everything could just go back to the way it was.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 You're still here?  Yup.
Still here.
 Stop it.
 Wake up, captain dumbshit.
I've been trying to get in touch with you for two months.
Ow.
Okay.
I'm awake, I'm awake.
Aah! What is it? If the studio wants to sue me, tell them to take my house.
I belong to the sea now.
 Are you drunk?  Only on adventure.
And gin.
And vodka.
And gin.
They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.
 What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
 I don't know, ask Turteltaub.
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.
You've been here this whole time? Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn should do Shut up.
Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.
What orphanage? Remember at Herb's funeral, I asked you what you wanted me to do  with your Horsin' Around residuals?  I do not remember that.
You said, Give it to an orphanage or something.",Humor
"  What?  It turns out you made enough money to build a brand new one.
So congratulations.
You're a hero.

"Anyway, enjoy the sandwich, you're a great man.",Humor
Welcome to The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.,Humor
"Or, as we call it, The BoJack Horsephanage.",Humor
You cannot call it that.,Humor
"A, because I am not a great man and B, because that is a really stupid name.",Humor
The name was Molly's idea.,Humor
Stop pissing off the orphans.,Humor
A lot of them grow up to be serial killers.,Humor
Thank you for that lovely song.,Humor
But I'm not a good person.,Humor
This is the only good thing I've ever done and I did it by accident.,Humor
"And it just goes to show you life is just Ah, what am I saying? I don't have to tell you how hard life is.",Humor
You're the ones with the dead parents.,Humor
My parents are dead?  No.,Humor
No.,Humor
Not necessarily.,Humor
Maybe they just didn't want you.,Humor
"My point is, I don't understand how people live.",Humor
"It's amazing to me that people wake up every morning and say, ""Yeah, another day, let's do it.",Humor
" How do people do it? I don't know how.
Yay.
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser must navigate the most sensitive of areas.
 And I'm not just talking about the butt.
 Ha.
Copernicus, how do you always come up with these amazing butt jokes? When you're a Level Nine, as I am, you don't come up with butt jokes.
You live truthfully in the moment and the butt joke comes to you.
So true.
So wise.

I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of production.,Humor

Do? What do? Movie's finished.,Humor
We fixed the whole thing in post.,Humor
"Really? Remember your first week, these nerds made a computer scan of your head so we could finish if something happened? Please don't call us nerds, sir.",Humor
"Something happened to you, so these nerds finished the movie.",Humor
Look what Computer BoJack can do.,Humor
"Help you out of that tree, ma'am?  Look at him save that cat.",Humor
Now there's a protagonist we can root for.,Humor
You did all that in the computer?  Not just that.,Humor
Computer BoJack had so much charisma and screen presence we ended up going back  and replacing you in every scene.,Humor
"I'm not in the movie at all? Not technically, but computer you is giving the performance of your career.",Humor
"When people see what you do in this movie, they are gonna storm Daniel DayLewis's house, schlep him out into the street, shoot him in the head.",Humor
That's how good your performance is.,Humor

"My wife and I are going to the ballet tonight, there's a real ish with the restaurant.",Humor
"This is the wife you're divorcing, right?  You know how it is.",Humor
"You say you want a divorce and she says, ""No, we can make this work.",Humor
" You go to counseling and remember why you fell in love with her in the first place and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.
We've been sleeping together for three months.
 We're about to start a company together.
 None of that has to change.
I am definitely going to divorce her probably, it's just Ugh.
It's hard to explain to someone who's never been married.
 Listen, this is  Oh! Sorry, Katie just said something funny.
 What?  I gotta hop.
I love you, though.
Ha, ha.
Okay, keep the engine running, I'll be back in a Oh.
 Hey.
 Hey.
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.

It's the comedy cruise line People magazine  once called a comedy cruise line.",Humor
"  Comedy cruise line? Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?  It was two months ago.
You missed it.
 Sorry.
 No, you're not.
 Well Hey, do you remember the morning after my first night here? I don't know why everyone keeps asking if I remember things.
I don't.
Just as a general rule, if your question begins, Do you remember"" and doesn't end with ""how much you hated Moulin Rouge,"" the answer's no.",Humor
I was so happy to have a place to stay that I made pancakes.,Humor
And you kept eating them so I kept making them.,Humor
And then you got mad at me for letting you eat so many pancakes.,Humor
"You tried to chase me around the pool, but you were too hungover and also full from the pancakes so instead you took a nap.",Humor
"And when you woke up, you said, ""Thanks for the pancakes.",Humor
Now get out of my house.,Humor
"  I don't remember any of that.
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out, just like you wanted.
Good.
Honestly, you'll probably be better off without me.
Yeah.
But we had some good times, though, right?  Did we?  Right.
Well, um, take care.
Hey, I hope you can find a way to be happy, BoJack.
 I really do.
 Yeah, okay.
Hey, Todd? You need to get your shit together.
 Ugh.
 Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.
I want you to come onboard and write celebrity tweets.
 I don't know how to do that.
 You're a ghostwriter.
It's the same as writing a book, they're just a lot shorter and more people read them.
All right, but why are you helping me? Because my life is a mess right now and I compulsively take care of other people when I don't know how to take care of myself.
Oh.
I was hoping it was because you believed in me.
I don't.
Welcome to my Giggleship.
For us, it's a place to realize our higher selves.
For the paying public, it's a place to watch improv and drink watereddown margaritas for 8.
99.
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.
No, no, you just get paid in experience and stage time.
 Which in a way is even better than money.
 Say what? Look, We've arrived at your living quarters.
Wow.
No more couchsleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.
That's the spirit.
And you can use improv to make this room anything you want it to be.
My cabin is exactly like yours, but when I use my imagination, it becomes a rich stateroom with a treasure chest full of booty.
I like a big booty, if you know what I mean.
And I don't mean a butt.
You really are the master of spontaneous witticisms.
All right, you ready? This is go time.
There's no turning back now.
 Oh, I am ready.
 Great.
Now let's get out there and tell all those garbage rat bastard sons of bastards what we really think of them, once and for all.
Everyone.
We have an announcement.
Guys, we have an announcement.
 What's going on?  Mr.
Witherspoon's in the hospital.
 He had a stroke.
 Oh.
Well, you know what you rat bastards can stroke?  Uh Oh.
 My big, hairy Well, we burned that bridge.
Todd, you should be up a magician's sleeve because you are a card.
Hey, Bryan.
What's going on here?  He refused to scrub the floors.
 Oh, Bryan.
Please.
My knees were cramping so I needed to stand.
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.
That's solid spacework.
Bryan, don't worry.
I'm gonna go to Copernicus and get this sorted out.

"Can you really afford to be picky?  What? I'm just saying, what, you think you're gonna find some perfect unattached guy who's gonna love you like I do? Who's gonna make you laugh and feel good about yourself? This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.",Humor
"If you're holding out for something better, well, I hate to break it to you, but you're gonna be alone for a long time.",Humor

"Well, define ""weird.",Humor
"  You look doughy.
Do you run?  Cardio? Anything?  I mean, occasionally.
Excuse me? That was such a beautiful performance.
 So brave.
 Thank you.
Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that?  Feel that energy!  They don't love me.
 They don't know me.
 That's why they love you.
He's right.
Our research shows America likes to think they know you, and then they like learning more about you, but at a certain point they pass a threshold where they actually know you and then they find you weird and offputting.
Are you saying that nobody who really knows me could ever love me?  No, no, no.
Not nobody.
No.
 No.
What am I doing here? I don't know where you're going, but if you could run there.
Sextina, hi.
Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.
Listen, chitch, if you're going to tweet for Sextina Aquafina, you need to capture the essence of my personal brand, okay? All upper caps, no punctuation, lots of cryptic bullshit about the Illuminati and make sure to mention my preferred brands, okay? Beats by Dre, Abercrombie and Fitch and brand fin polish.
 Can you spell that last one?  No.
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.
Hey, thank you so much.
You people are the real stars.
Huh? Hi.
I'm Sarah Koenig.
This is one ringtone told over the course of several rings.
And the story it's telling you is to answer your phone.
 Hello?  Hey, Diane.
Hey.
Uh So How's Cordovia? It's hard.
 Do you know where the batteries are?  What?  The batteries in the remote died.
 Did you check the junk drawer? Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.
I'm gonna take them out of the smoke detector.
 No, don't do that.
 Well, I'm out of options.
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I think maybe you should get back here  so you can help me find the batteries.
 Yeah? I know you're doing important work and it's a long way to travel, but I need you here and I think you should come home.
 Is that really what you want?  Of course it is.
Well, okay, I'm looking at this website right now and it says if I leave immediately, I can still make it home tonight.
 That sounds great.
 I love you.
I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.
There is a woman in this restaurant who looks just like you.
I guess I just have one of those faces.
Okay, party people, we have time for one more suggestion.
 Todd.
 Did someone say movie theater? I heard movie theater.
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear my giant hat to the movies.
Who's this sitting behind me? John Wilkes Booth.
Uhoh.
 Todd, it's me, BoJack.
 BoJack?  Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
 I can't leave.
I need to take suggestions.
Okay, well, here's a suggestion, your name is Todd.
You're 24, you live on my couch and you've always seen the good in me somehow.
You've been brainwashed into thinking that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.
If you're any kind of improviser, you'll take that suggestion and you'll run with it.
Huh.
Let's get out of here.
I'm afraid that getting out of here is not an option.
 You've seen too much.
 What the hell are you gonna do about it?  Stop you.
With these.
 Oh, no.
 Don't do anything crazy, guys.
 You can't be serious.
 Just get behind me, BoJack.
 No sudden moves.
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.
Especially not when I have this smoke bomb.
Kapow!  I've lost them.
Where did they go?  Seriously? Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen with SPF a million which protects against flamethrowers.
Oh, no.
Now we finish this with our strangle machine.
Beep, boop, boop.
Machine?  Strangle those guys.
 Ugh! BoJack, help.
There is literally nothing happening to you.
You don't understand, if you die in improv, you die in real life.
So stupid.
Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine? Beep, boop, beep.
No.
I have a wife and children.
Well, they're improvised, but they're real to me.
 Can this be the end?  This whole ship is full of idiots.
Beep, boop.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.
Wait.
Where are you going? Sorry, improv is fun and great and everything, but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.
Your friend? I didn't realize this man was your friend.
Well, then, by all means, go with him, Todd.
But, see, I thought this was the man who sabotaged your rock opera.
The one who constantly abuses you and makes you shower with a hose in the yard.
I invited him to.
The one who's never said a kind word to you the entire time you've known him.
 Is this your friend, Todd?  It's more complicated than that.
 Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
 More than that, we're a family.
 I, uh  Hash browns.
 What?  I heard hash browns.
 Martha, did you see my hash browns?  Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off? It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.
You kept making them and I kept eating them and then I threw up in the pool.
That made you throw up in the pool.
Then I got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.
 But, you said, I'll clean it up.",Humor
"  And did I clean it up? No.
You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.
 Ha, ha.
 And you said, Thank you for letting me stay here.",Humor
I don't have anywhere else to go.,Humor
" And I remember when you said that, I don't have anywhere else to go,"" because I felt good about myself.",Humor
And I don't feel that way a lot.,Humor
Letting you stay with me was the best thing I ever did on purpose.,Humor
I don't think I ever told you that.,Humor
But I should have.,Humor
"Because you're my best friend, Todd.",Humor
"I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all that up, that was some really good improv.",Humor
Game recognize game.,Humor

"Horsin' Around?  No, actually.",Humor

"Other TV show? Oh, shit.",Humor
Jill.,Humor
I'm moving into the new office and I got Herb's ashes here.,Humor
I really don't know what to do with this thing.,Humor
Do you want it?  Yeah.,Humor
Why did I take you with me? Herb loved orphans.,Humor
"Mostly as a delivery apparatus for hackneyed punchlines and mawkish sentimentality, but still.",Humor
And we will do our part to honor his legacy.,Humor
"Hey, who's Jerb?  What? Jerb Ka Why does it say ""Jerb Kazzaz?"" Your email said ""Jerb.",Humor
" I forwarded it to the plaque guy.
 Is it not?  No, obviously that was a typo.
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz? Kind of sounds like something you'd get at a Mediterranean restaurant, but wouldn't finish.
And the waiter would say, You want me to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?""  And you'd say, ""No.",Humor
"  You gotta fix this.
Really? We spent a lot of money on this plaque, you know?  And on the tshirts.
 Jerb's kids? No, there's no Jerb.
It's Herb.
Tshirt's say Jerb so I'm going by the tshirts.
You know, Herb would probably think that this is pretty funny  that you couldn't even get this right.
 Yeah.
He would.
 So, in a way  Yeah.
You wanna get some Mediterranean food? You read my mind.
Oh, God.
Lungs on fire.
Ow.
Crap.
I hate this.
Running is terrible.
Everything is the worst.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
 It gets easier.
 Huh? Every day, it gets a little easier.
 Yeah?  But you gotta do it every day.
That's the hard part.
But it does get easier.
Okay.

1 (BOJACK) It's a dream come true.
(WOMAN) You've been trying to get this movie made for 20 years.
Did you ever think you'd be sitting here, talking about Secretariat? Sitting here? In this hotel room? (CLEARS THROAT) It's a dream come true.
What's it like to play Secretariat? Dream come true.
Playing Secretariat, what was that like? Dream come true.
(WOMAN) How long you in New York for? Just a couple days of fun interviews, then it's off to Chicago for more fun interviews, and then, if I don't blow my brains out, I get to go back to L.
A.
Darling, you're doing marvelously, I am so proud of you.
If I could make one slight adjustment? Maybe fewer jokes about how these interviews  make you want to blow your brains out?  Right.
Sorry.
I am so thrilled to be here, talking with, uh Yahoo Finland.
Yahoo Finland.
 Are you Finnish?  No, we are just getting started.
Walked right into that one.
What would an Oscar nomination mean for Mr.
BoJack Horseman? Any award recognition is just gravy.
The real joy is to sit in this hotel room all day, answering the same questions over and over again.
Great answers, you're divine.
I'm in love with you.
One small adjustment.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.
Just write a script for me, so I don't have to think for myself.
Honey, I would shove my hand up your ass and control your mouth like a Muppet if it would win you an Oscar.
What do I know? I'm just the publicist you hired to help win you an Oscar.
(WOMAN) What's it like to play Seabiscuit? I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.
(MAN) Your last attempt at a comeback was The BoJack Horseman Show.
Pass.
(MAN 2) People still see you as the guy from that sucky show from the '90s.
Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.
 Yeah, but it was.
 It lasted nine seasons.
Its whole purpose was for people to watch it so the network could sell ad time, so the show could make more money than it cost to produce.
It did that well.
It was a good show.
 Yes, but it sucked.
 It didn't suck! Great job today.
It could not have gone better.
My only note would be stop defending Horsin' Around.
Why? Millions of people loved it! We need to use these next few months to define your story.
When people see you they need to think Oscar winner, not dumb asshole from an old TV show that nobody cares about.
Okay, I hear what you're saying, but we can both agree Horsin' Around was a good show, right? BoJack, you know I think the world of you.
I think you are so smart and attractive, so I'm not going to mince words.
Horsin' Around was a piece of shit.
(FUNKY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Looking good.
Fantastic.
You need a coaster.
I told you to wear lipstick and underpants, Teresa.
I put everything billrelated in one folder.
Gas bill, cable bill, and the new headshots for Billy Zane.
 Thank you, Judah.
 You also wanted me to remind you  to call Mr.
Peanutbutter.
 Yeah.
Ping me again in two minutes? No, five minutes.
Uh, when's our call with BoJack and Spanakopita? The one that started seven minutes ago? It started seven minutes ago.
What? Diane's in your office right now, stalling poorly.
And that is my opinion on the Octomom.
Remember Octomom? (ANA) Diane, are you stalling for Princess Carolyn? What? You know who was good at stallin' was Joseph Stalin.
(CHUCKLES) (BOJACK) If anything, Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.
Get your head out of your ass.
He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,  who's been here the whole time?  Hey, buddy.
How was your first big day at the press junket? (SIGHS) Endless.
It was like the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.
He was exquisite.
The movie's tracking really well on social.
New media impressions are up 23 percent across platforms.
What does that mean? Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.
(CLEARS THROAT) But I keep tweeting things and they keep getting retweeted, so we're doing something right.
Yesterday I dropped my phone in the bathroom which made BoJack's Instagram post a picture of the floor, with the caption spujb.",Humor
" That got 4000 likes.
 (ANA) Great.
 I am exhausted.
Being a movie star is the hardest job.
And we get no recognition.
(GRUNTS) Okay, you're gonna love this.
I pulled some strings at Manatee Fair and set up an interview tomorrow night.
BoJack is not ready for a magazine feature.
Relax.
It's not that big a deal.
I didn't realize you were an authority on deal size.
(PRINCESS CAROLYN) Listen, Moussaka Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.
I can do all the bullshit things Ana's scheduled for me in the morning and still have time for Princess Carolyn's bullshit thing tomorrow night.
Now, pajamas.
 Whaa!  (GASPING)  Todd?!  What is going on over there? (ANA) BoJack smuggled a young boy into his room.
No big deal.
Movie stars do it all the time.
Where am I? (SNIFFS) Bagels? Pizza? (SNIFFING) Hipsters? Urine?  Am I in Minneapolis?  What? No, you're in New York.
FOLLOWUP: why are you in New York? Beats me.
Sometimes I just am places.
(MOANING) I can't get to sleep.
Oh, God.
(GROANS) Yeah, that'll do it.
(SIGHS) Is my name Sarah Koenig? Because I'm about to get cereal.
(MOANS) I am the queen.
Follow me, citizens.
There are no sad times in our cave of possibilities.
(SIGHS AND SNORES) (GRUNTING) (MONITOR BEEPS)  (BEEPING)  Huh.
Small bottle of shampoo?! Not on my watch!  (ALARM RINGING)  (SCREAMING) You better not have gotten your failure stink all over my important movie star clothes.
 Ohh  I didn't mean that.
You're my friend and you don't stink of failure.
Your stink is one of good intentions and youthful exuberance.
(TODD) Hooray, compliment! You wanted me to ping you regarding Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on, I have to make a quick call.
 What? You're already on a call.
 Sorry.
 Please hold.
 (ANA) This is ridiculous.
 Hello?  (PRINCESS CAROLYN) It's your agent! I wanted to remind you of your meeting with Pinky today.
I think I'm already in it.
(ANNOYED THROAT CLEARING)  Do I need to be on this call still?  I put you on conference.
How do I?  BoJack Horseman, is that you?!  Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic you posted yesterday.
Spujb! Classic BoJack.
We should get together sometime and take a selfie.
I'd love to, buddy, but I'm kinda in New York right now.
(PEANUTBUTTER) New York City?! They make such great salsa.
I'm here too, honey.
Have a great meeting! Diane?! Wait, you went to New York?  (DIANE) No.
I'm just on  Why wouldn't you tell me? How long are you I'm not accusing.
I just I feel safer when I know that I know where you are.
 I affirm your feelings  (BOJACK) I don't want to your feelings have value, but I'm not in New York, I'm just on the conference call.
 Guys, can we  (PEANUTBUTTER) I feel heard.
 (DIANE) I hear that you feel heard.
 What the hell is happening?  Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!  What?! (TODD) As Carrie from Sex and the City might say  I'm Carrie.
 (PEANUTBUTTER) Todd? In the naked city? (CHUCKLING) That is going to lead to some wackiness.
You mark my words.
Would you guys literally mark my words? I do want to refer back to this later on.
We're in the middle of a meeting! (PEANUTBUTTER) Got to go.

So as long as you two stick around  I'm taking the show off the air.,Humor

Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you, BoJack Horseman, completely naked and covered in milk.
 I'll stop you there.
 It's a symbol for rebirth.
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.
I'm still recovering from being birthed the first time.
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things that are challenging, or edgy, or covered in milk.
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.
I want to do things that connect with people, things that last.
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.
No, I know, but see, years after I die, people will still be able to see me in Secretariat.
 And then what?  And then I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.
 And then what?  Then my life will have meaning.
 I don't know!  Mmhmm.
You know what the real tragedy of Greg KingLear is? Two hours long without an intermission? It's that he's a marionette.
And he doesn't even know someone else is pulling his strings.
Mmm, I don't think the chef whispered his dreams into this.
This does not taste like dreams.
You told me I would be getting more attention at a smaller agency, but if anything, I'm getting less.
Is this the best time to be on your phone? I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email What? Why isn't it sending? Judah! I'm taking my business to Gekko Rabitowitz.
What? No! J.
D.
Salinger is too big a star to be hamstrung by some rinkydink operation working out of a twostory warehouse.
I need an agency with at least nine stories.
Uh That was a reference to my work, with which you are clearly not familiar.
 Oh  Goodbye.
Hello to you, Rasputin.
 Give my regards to the czar.
 I will relay the message.
Oh, I don't know why I thought I could do this.
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.
I believe I can take on more responsibility around here.
 On a provisional basis, of course.
 Okay.
But we're a small agency and we need to think like one.
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner, we should focus on better gigs for the clients we already have.
 Oh.
Like Jerry Maguire.
 Yes.
 What part of Jerry Maguire?  The part where Tom Cruise's agent got him a massive payday for being in Jerry Maguire.
(RINGTONE) Who's that dog? Mister Peanutbutter Princess Carolyn?! Listen, kid, tough break about the Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities Whatever, Whatever, Whatever, but what are we gonna do next? I was looking forward to taking some time off.
What? That is the worst idea I've ever heard.
You're the biggest name in TV right now.
and every network would love to air your next project.
Why don't you get off your lazy keister and come up with some TV ideas and make us all billionaires? Go get us some money.
Go get it, boy.
You can do it! Go! Atta boy! (BARKING) Daddy, it's so nice having you home.
These last few months have been amazing.

No! The lyrics are too relevant.
Don't do it.
 No!  (ENGINE REVVING) (BOTH LAUGHING) So, what's next for BoJack? What do you mean, What's next?"" Why does everything have to have a next? I just mean, after Secretariat's all over, what are you going to do next? We were told this feature would be pegged to the release of Secretariat.",Humor

Hey! Aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around? (SIGHS) You see, this is why I don't go out amongst the notfamouses.
Just do me a favor and take this meeting.
 (GROANS)  If you're a good boy, we can do that weird French thing you saw in that Internet video.
Ooh, parkour? This show came to me when I was in rehab.
I realized I'm only here on this earth for a bit, why not dig deeper?  Huh.
 Don't get me wrong.
I'm proud of the seven years I spent on Krill & Grace.
That show did so much for the way society views krill people.
That show didn't make me happy.
The awards, the money didn't make me happy.
Did you try spending the money on things? I started to feel like I was trapped in a giant plastic ball.
BoJack, meet my lovely assistant, Jill Filipowicz.
 Hey.
 Hi.
 Did I say you could speak, wench?  You can't talk to me like that.
(GRUNTS)  Clean up that mess this instant!  No.
I'm a dirty girl.
 Uh  I'm filthy.
 You are being very bad.
 You'll have to punish me later.
(BOTH CHUCKLING) Jill and I have a very special relationship.
Want to tell me about the show? I hear it's great.
I've worked on great shows my whole career.

"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece, 'An Open Letter to Open Letters', wasn't right for us, despite its evident merit.

We were like Heidi and Spencer up in there.
So you're gonna do the show?  Nah.
Timing's really off right now.

I'm done.
That's it, I'm tired of bending over backwards for you.
I mean this in all seriousness, professionally or in bed? Why won't you do this? Give me one good reason.
Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if I'm not? What if there's a reason the only thing I'm known for is Horsin' Around? BoJack, you are amazing.
You're bright and you're funny and you're handsome and you're talented.
But if you can't see that, then you're the biggest, dumbest piece of shit in the world.

I know you'd rather be in here with Kimber.
That's not true.
It's just that, Emily  What?  I've never kissed anyone before.
That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other? That way, when you're in here with Kimber one day, you'll know exactly what to do.
Okay, so how should we do it? French style, Eskimo, Butterfly? I'll tell you.
I know exactly what to do because I practice all the time with a picture of Adam Brody No, I don't! (CHUCKLES) Just close your eyes, and we move our faces toward each other.
 Okay.

Aaah!  Jeez, sleep much?  Jeez, watch me sleep much? Well, I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking about today's first readthrough.
These things are always so nervewracking, to sit there and perform for all these people like some kind of a  Professional actor?  Very funny.
 Before I forget, I got you a present.
 (GASPS) It's a box with crinkly tissue paper inside it.
How did you know? Thank you for putting this whole thing together.
Even though I still can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Promise me everything's going to be okay? I promise it's gonna be great.

I can't promise everyone will love this show.
No matter what, people will remember it.
Five, ten years from now, this is the show people will associate you with, and you'll be glad they do.

A lesser talent couldn't have pulled it off.

Why buy these spaghetti strainers in the first place? Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.
Man, married life is weird.
We're making an effort and getting stronger every day, but I swear to God we are like five big fights away from a divorce, I do not want this to be one.
Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.
Is marinara all right, or will I need something zestier like Arrabiata? Tomato bath.
Whoa! I am so high right now.
Wait, was there a skunk in here?  What do you know about Nadia?  Uh, who's Nadia? Your friend doing the facedown mambo in the kingsized bathtub.
 Now I know her name is Nadia.
 Oh, so you're a comedian, huh? Although I am trying to branch into more serious roles.
You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.
 Yeah, what are they?  I mean, I don't know them know them.
But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick? You're not gonna look up your rights, are you? What? No.
I'm just supposed to moderate an Emily VanCamp livechat talkback on Snapchat.
Let me just set up the user preferences here, and you can't detain us unless we're under arrest.
Damn it.
You were looking up your rights, weren't you? Nope, that was just a thing I already knew.
Everyone's stupid rights these days.
I never get to have any fun.
 Let's get out of here.
 BoJack, I need to show you something.
This is Nadia's phone.
I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.
Check this out, the last text message she sent.

I was embarrassed by the person I was when I was staying with you.
I'm trying not to be that person.

You know my real name.,Humor
I actually seriously don't.,Humor
"We just wanted to know why everyone was talking about how BoJack kills? Why would you implicate me in your drug business? Wait, I get what happened.",Humor

I said it's not the whales.,Humor
You said it's not just the whales.,Humor
There's more to this story.,Humor
What are we missing? Cuddlywhiskers.,Humor
"What was Nadia doing in his backyard in the first place? What was this ""system""? And where is he now? Why was it so important to Jill to get that letter back? Oh, yeah, the letter.",Humor

He always loved to disappear up there.,Humor

Of course.,Humor
Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, I understand and affirm your feeling I'm glad you're safe.",Humor
I was worried about you.,Humor
"What I'm hearing you say is you were  No, stop.",Humor
You have to call me.,Humor

BoJack? Mmm.,Humor
"After The BoJack Horseman Show fell apart, I got depressed a long time.",Humor
"Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies, I made a ton of money, but it wasn't fulfilling.",Humor
"I remember when I won my Oscar, standing up on that stage, looking at the statue and thought, ""This is supposed to be the happiest moment of my life.",Humor
" And I never felt more miserable.
 Oh.
Because you're sober?  Because an Oscar is meaningless.
It's all meaningless.
I dedicated myself to helping others.
I turned my home into a halfway house for troubled addicts.
I had this system for recovery, and it helped a lot of them, but even more slipped through the cracks.
That, too, left me empty.
Everyone was worried about you, you know.
You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.
Sometimes you need to take responsibility for your own happiness.
You don't think that's a little selfish? I don't know what to tell you.
I'm happy, for the first time in my life.
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.
It takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are, even longer to see it doesn't have to be that way.
Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy.
Can you believe that guy? What a nut, right? I just wanna go home.
Boxer vs.
Raptor, 

1 Why do I have to go to this thing? If we want to be a legitimate awards contender, Secretariat needs to make an appearance at a big festival.
I can't just go to Cannes? You Cannes not.
Apparently, the French do not care for you ever since you said that thing in the press.
Hey, I stand by my critique of Sartre.
His philosophical arguments helped tyrannical regimes justify overt cruelty.
Also, the French smell and I hate them.
And you can't go to Sundance because Robert Redford hates you.
Someone had to tell him The Horse Whisperer was offensive.
Sorry, but real horses don't just do whatever someone says.
And that's why you need to go to this festival.
(SIGHS) If you say so.
The Pacific Ocean Film Fest, or POFF, is the biggest underwater film festival in the world.
You make a splash there, people are going to notice.
Fine.
All you need to do is get to the premiere on time, 8:00.
Walk the red carpet, wave at the crowd, kiss some fish babies.
(GROANS) Fish.
They're so annoying.
(SQUEAKING) Sorry, lady.
No habla fish talk.
You need to be sensitive to their culture.
Things are different down there.
You know what a thumb's up means, right? Yes, I know what a thumb's up means.
I'll be fine.
Oh, I wanted to warn you.
Kelsey Jannings is also going to be at the festival.
Kelsey? No.
She has another film there.
I haven't talked to her since she got fired from Secretariat.
Well, luckily you won't have to talk much because you'll both be underwater.
God, I haven't been underwater since my mother tried to drown me in the bathtub when I was 22.
I can't do this, Ana.
I'm sorry.
Sir.
I'm getting off.
You can't.
We've already pressurized the cabin.
Sir, please return to your seat.
No.
I don't want to do this.
You can't make me.

Hey, buddy, big day.
 (MOANS) No.
 Big premiere day.
 Stop.
Secretariat in theaters now.
 How exciting.
 Please stop.
People are seeing your movie, forming opinions, judging you, all over the country.
 What are you doing?  Or not.
Maybe nobody's seeing it.
Wouldn't it be weird if literally nobody saw your movie? How do I get out of this conversation? JUST THINK: by this time tomorrow, we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.
The air crackles with possibilities.
 Oh, good lord.
(GROANING)  Uhoh.
It's all over.

It is a very popular ridesharing app, you'd think they could vet their drivers better.
Which app is that? I probably shouldn't say, for legal reasons.
I think we all know which one I'm talking about.
You know what would solve a lot of problems? If there was a rideshare app for women that only had women drivers.
That is such a good idea, Todd.

 Hey! Uh, what? So, before the procedure, you'll need to look at an ultrasound and listen to the heartbeat.
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.
Why does she have to listen to the heartbeat? It's the law.
Also, by law, I have to tell you that at one month, your puppies have a favorite color and that color may be blue.
 That can't be true.
 By law, I have to tell you that.
Also, before your procedure, you'll need to watch 20 hours of cute puppy videos as Sarah McLachlan's I Will Remember You"" plays softly.",Humor
"Don't worry, Diane, I will watch the cute puppy videos for you.",Humor
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.,Humor

Jurj sucks.,Humor

"  Is that right?  That is exactly correct, A Ryan, but I am very excited for this opportunity to put a face on this important issue.
One out of three women will have an abortion in her life.
That sounds crazy high to me, I don't buy it.
I wanted to destigmatize the experience for all women out there, so I'm dropping a new single.
 What?  Surprise!  New single?  Just relax.
Crack an egg on your head, feel the yolk drip down.

I'm a baby killer Baby killing makes me horny Alien's inside me I'm gonna squash it like Sigourney No, stop.
Get that fetus, kill that fetus Brrap brrap pew pew Christ, stop the tape.
Glasses, you did this.
You empowered me to tell my story.
I think the tone might be a little severe? Look, when you get an abortion, you can express yourself however you want, but this is about my body and my choices, and my choice is to be a totally insane badass.
Ugh! I am getting an abortion.
You're not even really pregnant.
So? This is show business.
Brrap brrap.",Humor
Pew pew.,Humor
 Brrap brrap.,Humor
Pew pew.,Humor
" A daring battle cry from the selfappointed New Voice of Choice.
But has the concept of women having choices gone too far? We've assembled this diverse panel of white men in bow ties to talk about abortion.
Gentlemen? Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.
I'm a man, but if I got pregnant, would I put my life on hold for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.
I can say that with confidence, because I will never have to make that decision, so I'm unbiased.
 Does this video glamorize abortion?  Very possibly, Tom.
Millennials today think everything is NBD.
NBD of course stands for No BD, referring to B.
D.
Wong, who teens think is a very big deal.
So if something's not BD, it means it's not a big deal.
 These days, abortions are not BD.
 Are abortions even necessary? I heard a theory that if a woman really has an unwanted pregnancy, the body has a way to break the fetus down into gas particles and then she can just fart it out.
Where did you hear this intriguing fart it out"" theory?  I don't remember.",Humor
Maybe the Bible?  Thank you for clarifying.,Humor

That's the point.,Humor

Can I abort talking to you right now? Abort.
 You need to stop and think  Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me? I am just here for emotional support.

Enough.
I am not your driver.
It is I, BoJack.
BoJack? What are you doing? I was gonna prank Jurj by hitting him with this bat, but you got into the car because, apparently, you are a twotiming liar.
What's the thing with the bat? BoJack, this is not a good look on you.
All this time, I thought you believed in me.
This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.
It has nothing to do with whether you're a good publicist or not.
I am a marvelous publicist.
Not to me.
You're doing great work for this asshole who loves pranks.
You're pranking him right now.
Yeah, with a bad prank to show how stupid pranks are.
Seems a little convoluted, which is actually a trademark of a great prank.
Well played, sir.
No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point.
Pranks are dumb.
We're late, and I won't keep going round and round with you on this.
Publicists have many clients.
Not my publicist.
You're fired.
Are you kidding? Who fires Ana Spanakopita? I do.
I just did.

If we're gonna do this, we got to be real tasteful.
Yeah, only the best for my abortion.

John Carpenter can do the practical effects.
 He owes me a favor.

Great idea.,Humor
The worst part is things have actually been going really well with Todd.,Humor
Our friendship is in a really good place.,Humor
"Last week he said, ""Did you know the wiener dog is neither a wiener nor a dog?"" Instead of saying, ""Shut up, Todd,"" I said, ""Okay.",Humor
" [The Closer] So, why did you sleep with Emily? Do you think that part of you was getting uncomfortable with that closeness? You felt like you didn't deserve Todd's friendship and you wanted to somehow externalize that feeling into action? No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that? When you do bad things, you have something you can point to when people eventually leave you.
It's not you, you tell yourself, it's that bad thing you did.
Do you often keep people at arm's length? Are you afraid of being known and knowing others? Yeah, you know, I think that you're definitely hitting on something real that I would love to drill down into, but I gotta go to this marketing meeting now.
Which is so annoying because I totally want to keep talking about that thing you're talking about.
But marketing meetings, right? I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow?  Of course.
 Great.
Bye.
 So, how was your marketing meeting?  Weird.
 Sorry I'm late.
 It's fine.
We're just getting started.
I had the worst morning.
Hanging on every word.
Don't tell us.
So I drove here, right? I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage when I realize I don't have my key card.
I gotta drive all the way home to get it.
When I got there, I couldn't find it anywhere.
Suddenly, I remember, I put it in the glove compartment.
It was in my car the entire time.
Okay.
Because I was driving back and forth so much, I ran out of gas.
I pulled into a 76.
I was about to pump the gas, I realized I didn't have my credit card, when I remembered it was on my desk at home because I used it to contribute to my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.
Diane Have you donated to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?  Oh, shit.
 Throw her 50 bucks.
You can afford it.
Yeah, but I don't like feeling like I have to, Roxy.
Does the world need a stopmotion short film about a pig who goes to circus school? Think of it like you're doing a nice thing for your friend.
Mmm okay.
I called a cab to take me home to get my credit card.
Then back to the gas station, get my car, fill it up and come here.
So that's why I'm late.
 Why did you tell us that whole story?  I don't know.
 Why did you tell me that whole story?  I don't know.
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up some options for the new Secretariat ads.
Good news is the movie is killing out there.
Everyone loves it.
If everyone loves it, why do we need a new ad campaign? These are the For Your Consideration"" ads.",Humor

This is exactly what you want.,Humor
"[The Closer] What do you think she meant by that? Better question, why am I still getting the L.",Humor
A.,Humor
Gazette? Do you think getting the paper every day is a reminder of Todd's papiermÃ¢chÃ© head? The project he abandoned to make time for the old girlfriend you spent an intimate night with? Could that be why you want to cancel your subscription? No.,Humor

 Truth.
What is the worst recent thing you did to someone who cared about you?  The worst thing? Or the most recent?  Both.
Can you keep it down, please? Some people are trying to sleep.
 We are keeping it down.

" And I'll be up all night wondering what you're talking about.

What would we be talking about? I don't know.

How long have you been in here? Well, after the incident in Yorba Linda.

And you've been living here ever since? That's right.
I also did an arc on The Good Wife.
 Other than that, laying low.
 The Good Wife? How did you go on a nationally broadcast TV show with no one catching you? I disappeared into the role, BoJack.
It's called acting.
Try it sometime.
And you're the one who's been stealing our food.
You already know too much.
Smoke bomb.
Hiyah!  Why did you throw a plum on the floor?  Thought it was a smoke bomb.
Where are my smoke bombs? I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.
 Hey.
BoJack's back.
 Yup.
My two favorite people in a room together with me.
 You bet.
 Isn't this great, BoJack?  The three of us under one roof?  Yeah.
It's like Three Men and a Baby.
But there's only two men, and the baby's a lady.
 [laughing]  Uhhuh.
[yawning] [chattering] [sighing] [The Closer] With all this turmoil and upheaval, sure would be nice to have something you can depend on.
Something that arrives every day at your doorstep, with a robust arts section.
Let me tell you something about the L.
A.
Gazette.
I don't think you finished the story about your publicist.
What happened when you told her you wanted to know her? Oh, right.
Well If we're gonna work together and also have weird kinky car sex, I wanna know something about you.
What do you wanna know? I was married once.
I have a son I'm not allowed to see.
 My favorite fruit is honeydew.
 Gross, is that true? Does it matter? Listen, I've been with guys like you before, and I know this thing works better if we keep a little distance.
And [grunting] [groaning] Well, that worked.
Okay, we're done.
I'll see you tomorrow.
[The Closer] So, that's how you left things? [BoJack] That's how she left things.
But then I followed her home.
[The Closer] You did what? [BoJack] She lives in this tiny apartment in the Valley.
I could see her through the window and I just watched her being normal.
Oh! [sighing] [The Closer] There's something very intimate about watching a person be herself.
[BoJack] But it wasn't good intimate, like when you see your mom cry.
It was bad intimate, like when your dad writes a poem about Lena Horne's nipples, makes you read it out loud so he can hear if it scans.
[The Closer] She warned you that you wouldn't want to know her.
[BoJack] Yeah.
She was right.
It's so sad that when you see someone as they really are, it ruins them.
 Do you have someone you can talk to?  About what? These feelings you have, your selfdestructive behavior.
You know that old joke about how many psychiatrists does it take to screw in a light bulb? The answer is just one, but the light bulb has to want to change?  I don't know that joke.
 That's it.
That's the whole joke.
The light bulb has to want to change.
[laughing] Yeah.
Psychiatrists are idiots.
That's actually not the point of the joke.
 Hey.
I need to talk to you.
 What the I'm on the phone.
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.
Oh, it's too much heat.
I'm taking your boat out to international waters.
You never saw me.
On the phone.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
What I want is to have control over my own life.
[engine starting] Which is why I'm begging you to please cancel my delivery of the L.
A.
Gazette.
 I don't think you want to do that.
 I promise you I do.
No, because that's just theater.
It allows you to think you're in control, but the whole idea of control is a myth.
The universe is a wild beast.
You can't tame it.
All you can do is try to live inside it.
Live inside the beast? That's a mixed metaphor.
 But you're right.
 Great.
I'm going to sign you up for another six months.
Since you've been such a sport, I'm throwing in a tote bag.
Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.
Okay, so I'm a passenger.
Remember the three D's: drive safely, drive efficiently, and don't harass the passenger.
 Todd, can I talk to you for a second?  Sure.
Driver, pull over, please.
 [imitating car braking]  [imitating opening door]  Can I talk to you alone?  Of course.
Driver, put up the partition, please.
[imitating partition whirring] I've been thinking, and you should do this without me.
What? But the whole point is we're doing it together.
But you don't need me anymore.
You have a whole team of coders, and I don't think that I can work in this house.
 What's wrong with the house?  Todd, I just  I need to go.
 [imitating opening door] I don't understand.
Did I do something to make you feel uncomfortable? No.
You are great.
It's me and BoJack.
BoJack? [sighing] What did he do this time? I don't think I've been a very good friend to you.
Things happened and I don't think BoJack's been a very good friend to you either.
 Oh, okay.
 You should buy me out of the company.
No, no, no, keep your share.
Who knows? It might be worth something someday.
You're sweet, Todd.
You shouldn't waste that on people who don't deserve it.
Hey, you want this plum? I found it in the kitchen.
Sure.
 [smoke bomb fizzing]  [both] Whoa! [coughing] Weird plum.
[knocking on door] How did you know where I live?  Ana  You need to leave.
No, I know that it's exciting to remain mysterious and in control, but control is a myth.
That's a conclusion I came to recently by myself.
I can't do this now.
I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed, I wanna see what you look like waking up.
You are a beautiful, sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.
And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.
And you don't have to be, either.
Okay.
And I want to go with the mirror ads for Secretariat.
 BoJack, no, listen.
 Ana.
This is my campaign, I know what I'm doing.
Call up Turteltaub and tell him I won't be pushed around on this.
I'm the star and what I say goes.
Okay.
[cars honking] [Ana] Hmm [Carolyn] It kind of just looks like a billboard for the sky.
 I didn't think this part through.
 No kidding.
The sky is Secretariat? The sky wants you to nominate it for an Oscar? It is eerily beautiful.
Like an art piece that resists interpretation.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Wouldn't want the ad for my movie to be interpretable.
If you stand where I'm standing, you see a reflection of the KIISFM billboard.
Beautiful.
So we spent half a million dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIISFM.
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.
When the sun goes down and hits that billboard, that's gonna That's gonna be a real problem.
Well, the good news is BoJack got what he wanted.
 [sighing]  [bird screeching] [all gasping] Ugh.
Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  I'm BoJack the Horseman  BoJack BoJack the Horseman Don't act like you don't know 

When you two first came into my office, I was like, This marriage is not going to last.",Humor
" But you've really put the work in.
I deem your marriage fixed.
Thanks, Dr.
Janet.
We couldn't have done this without you and your many novelty certificates.
Well, this has certainly been a big year for the Rabitowitz marriage.
It certainly has.
But now it's New Year's Eve and, Katie, my New Year's resolution to you is to spend more time with my wonderful wife, who I I gotta take this.
 Oh, um, but  Hello.
Hey, partner, big news.
Huge news.
I'm all ears.
The Flight of the Pegasus just lost their lead.
They start shooting next week.
So what you're telling me is David Pincher needs a new star immediately for his threepicture young adult dystopian future franchise? Yup.
What's that I hear? Beep beep.
Someone's calling on the other line.
That's strange.
Hello? It's Oodles of Money calling.
Will we accept the charges? Why would Oodles of Money be calling collect? I don't know.
Don't accept the charges, we cannot afford it.
I gotta go in.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
But make sure you're back before, you know.
Deal.
Best deal I ever made.
Boom! What's black and white and sexy all over? Chuff Hollister.
He's young, he's hot, he's Australian or British or whatever.
We can paint over his stripes so he looks like a horse.
I can see the headline now, Chuff Hollister is The next Pegasus.
BoJack's got star power and grit up the wazoo.
I can't imagine Anyone who would appeal to the audience more than Chuff.
He's got sex appeal  Gravitas  Youth  Experience  And abs coming out of the wazoo.
And what a wazoo it is.
 This would put GekkoRabitowitz  On the map.
The map of profitable agencies, that is.
Perfect, because without it we could be in Real trouble.
We did not hit our projected earnings for the year.
The year's not over yet.
We still have one day to go all out.
Rutabaga, do you think we have the spunk and moxie That's a good name for a lady detective series.
Required to pull this off and save the agency? Hell yeah, I do.
That would be a great title for a movie about marrying Satan.
How are we losing money? Vanessa, we're getting Chuff this part and coming out on top.
I know we will, because we're the good guys.
Suck a duck a duck a dick, dumbshit.
 Hey, Sarah Lynn.
 Hey, loser.
Did you get a call about that Ethan Around thing?  You're not gonna do it, are you?  I'm sorry, what thing? Ethan Around, the Horsin' Around sequel series Brad's trying to get made? He called to ask me, I asked him, can you put a bullet in my brain? That would probably be a better career move.
Wait, slow down.
Did you say Ethan Around? I know.
It should be Sabrina Around, right? That's a show people would watch.
Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricks and eating kettle corn.
Hold on, if this was a real thing, why would Brad call you and not me? Who knows? Why do people do anything? Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma from Pocahontas my emergency contact? Are you sure this whole thing isn't just a semilucid fever dream from mixing the wrong pills? Did you not hear? I'm clean and sober, eight months.
Really? That's incredible.
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.
Because I heard if you stop doing drugs for a while, the first time you do them again, it's amazing.
 What? No, just stay sober.
 Ugh! Whatever.
Call me when you're ready to party.
Well, that's troubling.
Can you believe they're doing a Horsin' Around reboot without me? What do you care? You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.
Not the point.
This is about respect.
BoJack, is this really a good idea? Tools.
Brad speaking.
You're doing a new show in the extended Horsin' Around cinematic universe and you didn't call me? Hey, BoJack.
Ethan Around is just an idea I had.
It's not officially happening or anything.
I would love for you to be part of it, but the horse died in the series finale.
So? We could write around that.
The Horse dying was just a dream.
The Horse had a twin brother, comes back as a ghost.
Ethan missed the Horse so much he built a robot Horse as a tribute.
I've heard of overloaded motherboards, but this is ridiculous.",Humor
" Those are off the top of my head, they're all gold.
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.
I've been having trouble getting networks on the phone, but with a big star like you attached, we could sell this right away.
I wouldn't say I'm attached Don't move.
I'm getting the next flight down to LA.
 Right now?  And purchased.
BoJack, for the last 20 years I've been telling people I didn't need the trappings of fame, that I was better off, happy with my little Bplus life at my little Bplus hardware store in little Bplus Olympia, Washington.
Bminus children.
But it's a lie.
I miss the warmth of the spotlight on my face.
The thrill of telling a joke and feeling it land.
Is that a thrill you experienced? The sitcom stage is my home, and I'm tired of denying myself that.
I'm ready to come home.
Great.
 Why did you let me call him?  Ugh.
Ah, smell that Labrador Peninsula air.
Keep an eye out for my brother.
 How will I know which one's him?  He's the one that looks like me.
Got it.
 Hello?  Hey, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
Is this an okay time to talk business? Yeah, I'm just waiting for Captain Peanutbutter.
What is that, like, a cereal? No, my brother.
 He's picking us up at the airport.
 Nice.
Speaking of driving people places, Cabracadabra had a killer holiday season and I think New Year's is going to be even bigger.
I'm loving that segue, Todd.
You are a conversational Magellan.
Turns out there's a huge demand for a safe space for women.
Who knew? Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.
So I was thinking, what's the next step? What if we made our safe space for women also available to men? That's an untapped market.
All right, then it's agreed.
No goodbye? He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.
Mr.
Peanutbutter and Captain Peanutbutter in the same room? What is this, a flashback episode? Captain Peanutbutter, you old soandso.
 Get over here.
 Careful.
Where's Mrs.
Captain Peanutbutter? She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.
She sends her love.
And this noogie.
Whoo! Diane, this is my big brother.
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.
And you always will be.
It's nice to meet you, Captain.
Hey, put that thing away.
You're family.
Oh! So David Pincher is about to shoot the Flight of the Pegasus trilogy in New Zealand, and BoJack is perfect for the lead.
A part like that would really underline that BoJack's more than just an actor, he's a movie star.
If I'm doing that, I conveniently won't be able to do that dumbass Ethan Around show.
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.
Why don't you tell him you don't want to do it? I can't.
I'm like a father figure to him I slept with his mother.
 Gross.
 No.
I slept with her 20 years ago.
She was young then, not gross.
Ugh! Hey, loved you in The Caveman's Valentine.
 Hmm?  Nothing? The Caveman's Valentine? Samuel L.
Jackson had that big beard? Look it up.
 When you start laughing, call me.
 Will do.
Do we have an offer on the Pegasus movie? I'll get it, Kalamata.
Don't get your pita in a wad.
Wow.
Flight of the Pegasus.
This must be what Robert Downey Jr.
felt like when he woke up on that stranger's bathroom floor and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.
It's another unseasonably warm day in the Labrador Peninsula and things are looking sunny all the way to the new year.
It really is true what they say Nothing bad ever happens on the Labrador Peninsula.
Oh, paradise.
Uncle Mister.
Uncle Mister.
Now who let these little monsters onto my peninsula? We're your nephews.
What? I don't remember my nephews being made out of candy.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Look at those children.
Little miracles, right? They're adorable, not that I value them based on their looks.
Because, of course, children in society today are often reduced to their cuteness.
I can't wait to get to know your children as people, so I can specifically compliment them individually on the foundation of their characters.
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.
Uh  Do you believe in the soul?  What? Life is the most precious resource we have.
Remember that, Diane.
Okay.
Pretty great, right? Did you tell your brother about the ABORTION? The audition? No, I could never tell him about that.
He thinks I'm offeronly, it would break his heart.
Wait, what audition?  No, the abortion.
 Oh, no.
Should I have? He said some weird stuff to me earlier.
The kind of stuff you'd hear in a sad Creed song.
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya, but he's a good dog.
All bark, no bite.
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.
I guess in human terms it would be: He's all talk, and no shooting you with an assault rifle.
Is that what you think humans do? Am I wrong? Boom! This is David Pincher.
And this is everyone who works for him.
Now unfortunately for us, everyone on this board must really like their boss's movies, because for the holidays, they're all Gone Girl.
Thank you, except for her.
Boom.
The assistant to David Pincher's casting director.
Wait a second, I know that face.
Why does she look so familiar?  Oh, fish.
 Oh, fish.
So when I found out that the best assistant I ever had was working for David Pincher, I mean, what are the odds? Did he hire you because of your cute little Benjamin Buttonnose? I'll put in a good word for BoJack, but I'm just an assistant.
Just an assistant? Laura, assistants are everything.
You're the first people in, the last people out.
You know everyone's real name, age, nose, teeth, and tits.
You have power, because in today's economy the only true power is information.
I want you to use that power.
I want you to get your boss to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.
I always believed in you, Laura.
do you believe in yourself? Wow, that's I'm sorry, did you just make that up? Because that was Is that a speech you had ready to go?  Will you do this for me?  Of course.
You went to bat for me when I tried to get a promotion at Vigor.
I pushed so hard for you.
I did everything I could.
I mean, we gals gotta look out for each other.
Right? Right.
So you're talking about a merger? Since my dad croaked I've been running Vigor myself, and I've been doing a pretty good job, Aminus/Bplus.
But I could use a few more experienced hands to help guide the ship,  because being a boss is really hard.
 Yes.
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.
I'm glad you came to me first.
I would have gone to her directly, but sometimes she yells at me and I do not like being yelled at and that is just something that people need to understand about me.
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.
So on the new show Ethan is the dad, and he's raising three little horses.
You couldn't have told me this over the phone? This show is going to change my life.
I'm taking the kids out of school and moving everyone down here.
I just had an offer accepted on a house in Sherman Oaks.
As long as I don't change my mind before the new year, boom.
Two million dollars, gone.
 The new year? That's tonight.
 I know.
Did you talk to my agent by any chance?  No.
 She didn't call you? I talked to her, and I don't know if she wants me to do it.
You know how agents are.
Just remember, I'm not the bad guy here.
I hear you loud and clear.
Don't worry.
We won't take no for an answer.
I think my schedule's gonna be tough Might be going to New Zealand.
We'll work around your schedule.
Those bastards got my quote so damn high.
We'll pay it.
No obstacle is insurmountable.
 As long as you want to do it.
 And I do want to do it.
Get me out of this thing.
This asshole's giving me everything I ask for.
What a nightmare.
Tell him you don't want to do the show.
I can't.
It would destroy him.
Destroying people is what I pay you to do, so I don't think about the people I'm destroying.
Do you not know what an agent is? BoJack, are you okay in there? Is it number one or number two? That cat's running circles around us.
What are we going to do? Maybe we can distract her? I'm thinking laser pointer.
If we're going to beat her, we need to think like her.
Instead of convincing the Pegasus people they don't want BoJack, what if we convince BoJack he doesn't want Pegasus? Fantastic.
How do we do that? Kelsey.
Kelsey? That's what I said when they said you wanted to meet with me.
I figured you never wanted to see me again.
I never want to see anyone again, but there's a book I've been trying to turn into a movie and I need your help.
It's a comingofage story about a girl who likes jellybeans.
The option expires tonight at midnight, unless I can find a big enough star to secure funding.
Frankly, I already gave up on it.
Then my agent said, Maybe BoJack's interested.",Humor
" So the reason you think I'm right for the role is because I'm a big enough star to secure funding? Don't get smart, BoJack.
You're not good at it.
You're really giving the hard sell here.
I hear they've got you locked in to some fantasy dystopia thing.
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit for the rest of your life? For work or, like, in general? I saw something in you, something most people don't know you have, and it kills me that instead of sharing it with the world, you want to hide it under some wonderland unicorn nonsense.
It's a Pegasus.
Unicorns are for babies.
The movie I want to make isn't glamorous or sexy.
You don't get to be the big hero everybody loves.
You get to be a guy who works at a gas station, who gets in a fight with his daughter about jellybeans.
That's the whole movie.
It's small and it's real.
And you'd get to work with a director who sees you.
And I can't sell it any better than that.
You're right, that one scene we shot that didn't even make it into the Secretariat movie was the best thing I ever did.
Why am I wasting my time with this other stuff?  So you're in?  Let's do it.
Great.
How's your little friend with the face? Is he up to his old tricks, getting into scrapes? What a little scamp.
Will you tell him I said hi? Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.
Is it the nobody'sgonnaseeit element or the fact you'll be working for peanuts? This jellybean thing could show the world that BoJack's more than just a movie star.
 He's an actor.
 Yeah, well, that's great, but I've been working all day on getting him the Pegasus movie you said would show the world he's a movie star.
I don't want that anymore.
I want to do something real.
You realize how much money we'd be walking away from? This isn't about money.
Doesn't matter to me.
 Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.
 Right.
So what's the problem? Maybe you can find a way for BoJack to do both? You're supposed to be this amazing agent, after all.
I'll see what I can do.
New beers for the new year's? We got a regular Maya Angelou over here.
Good times.
Oh, it's Todd.
Gotta take this.
 Maybe you can call him back later?  Todd! Don't be too long, or I'm gonna drink all your beer.
Diane, do you ever look up at the stars and feel like they're tiny holes in the sky, sucking out all the oxygen, and suddenly you can't breathe because you're thinking about how small you are and how meaningless it all is? Uh I guess.
It's so cruel to let people love you.
All you're doing is promising you'll one day break their hearts.
Cool fire pit.
So it turns out men love safe spaces for women even more than women do.
You gotta read some of these comments.

The only problem is some of the drivers have been complaining about the new customer base.

"You got it, boss.",Humor
Number six.,Humor
You know how to make me laugh.,Humor
"So I'm a clown to you? Like Joe Pesci in Home Alone? [laughs] You recognize you're being impossible, right?  I don't know how you put up with me.",Humor
"I didn't put up with you, BoJack.",Humor
I liked being with you.,Humor
And I don't regret it.,Humor
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.,Humor
Or the bracelet you bought me for my 38th birthday.,Humor
Or when my dad died and you came to the funeral with me and held my hand.,Humor
I'm doing this for both of us.,Humor
You understand?  Did you ever love me? At all?  I don't I'm not You know that I don't do the whole love thing.,Humor
Either you end up hurting someone or they hurt you.,Humor
"So, what's the point? Yeah.",Humor
Ugh.,Humor
This sucks.,Humor
Ow.,Humor
I did this to myself.,Humor
I do this to myself.,Humor
Why do I do this to myself?  I don't know.,Humor
"Maybe if you're good at putting out fires, you just run from fire to fire and don't really think about [screams] Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef! I want to be not on fire!  We gotta put out that fire!  I hate Mondays! [groans] I figured out how to preheat the oven.",Humor
This night has been a disaster.,Humor
The good news is I got my kid to prep my important meeting at work.,Humor
The bad news is all the customers went home.,Humor
"They didn't like the screaming and felt like their food was a little too ""on fire"".",Humor
"It's called a char, dumbshits.",Humor
The critic's still here.,Humor
"Oh, oh, oh! She still wants her mushroom risotto.",Humor
I don't know how to make risotto.,Humor
I know how.,Humor
"What are you doing? No, go home.",Humor
You're right.,Humor
What am I doing? All right.,Humor
Good luck.,Humor
"[deep breath] Keep driving, keep driving Girl, don't turn that car around Break your pattern Of needing to fix other people Just keep on driving away Ugh.",Humor
Who do they write these songs for? Don't go back to the restaurant Princess Carolyn Just keep driving away  Ugh.,Humor
[music stops] Goddamn it.,Humor
How should I know? Do I look like an expert in cooking oils? We have to choose! We're running out of time.,Humor
Olive.,Humor
You wanna use olive oil.,Humor
What are you doing? Let me do this.,Humor
You'll burn the place to the ground.,Humor
Fine.,Humor
This isn't one of those things where you save my ass so I feel obligated to give you your job back.,Humor
I know you have no sense of obligation to me.,Humor
"Ooh, slam.",Humor
"I'm sorry, I'd rather not get involved.",Humor
Can I get you some more water?  Mmm.,Humor
You look lovely.,Humor
It's a great blouse.,Humor
"Mom, I wanna go home.",Humor
This is a very important night for the restaurant.,Humor
How are we coming on the sales meeting? Did you get the big conference room? Winslow wants the big conference room for his presentation to corporate.,Humor
You get back on that phone and you get me that big room.,Humor
"Okay, Mom.",Humor
The secret is stirring continuously.,Humor
"Right, so that's the secret.",Humor
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.,Humor
Thanks for your help.,Humor
Sure.,Humor
How do you know how to do this? Mom was a livein maid for a rich family.,Humor
She had a little trouble bending her elbow too much.,Humor
"Glug, glug.",Humor
"So unless I wanted us to be on the street, I had to cover for her, a lot.",Humor
That rich family loved Italian food and champagne fountains.,Humor
And cocaine.,Humor
And private jets.,Humor
And screaming at each other.,Humor
Who threw my cocaine in the champagne fountain?  So standard rich people stuff?  I guess.,Humor
How come you never told me that?  I did.,Humor
Oh.,Humor
It's okay.,Humor
I know you never remember anything.,Humor
That's not true.,Humor
I remember the first time we met.,Humor
I went to see Marv.,Humor
You were at the desk in front of his office.,Humor
"I thought you were cute and you said, ""It's good to see you again.",Humor
"  Oh.
So I guess we'd met before.
 That was the third time we met.
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.
You were passed out in the yard, covered in tapioca pudding.
I hosed you down, dragged you inside, covered you with a blanket.
 Really? I don't remember that.
 Shocker.
So you've gone from daughter of a maid to head of your own company.
Well, the company's not doing so hot.
 Don't try to guilt me.
 It's not your fault.
Turns out being an agent and running an agency are two different skills.
It's like asking a really delicious tomato to make you a tomato sandwich.
How's a tomato gonna make you a sandwich? He's got no arms.
You'll figure it out.
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter? Why are you an agent at all if it makes you so miserable? Because I'm good at it.
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.
Just 'cause you're good at something doesn't mean you have to do it.
I'm good at driving sober, but I don't relish the opportunity.
But what else would I do? Who else would I be? I do love you, by the way.
I mean, as much as I'm capable of loving anyone.
Which is never enough.
I'm sorry.
Tada! Well, it is truly how should I put this? Wonderful.
So you'll give Elefante a good review? Oh, no, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.
At one point, a waiter ran through the restaurant on fire.
Unfortunately, you will be receiving my lowest rating: four hundred and twelve stars, out of a possible a billion.
A billion stars? Yes, that's the rubric I use on SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.
tumblr.
com.
 Oh, God, get out.
 [exclaims] I assure you the animated GIFs with which I describe this encounter shall be scathing.
Mom! I just touched base with Rooney, re, Winslow.
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.
Perfect! This is the meeting where we finally convince the big boys to let us get babies addicted to vaping! Yes! Corporation! [all cheer]  How about a drink?  I could drink.
I don't think I can.
I'm heading out.
I got pretty badly burnt earlier and in a lot of pain.
I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.
[groans] Ha, ha! What's the second time we met?  A taping of Horsin' Around.
 Which episode? The one where Olivia put too much detergent in the washing machine.
[BoJack] Nancy Reagan was the guest star.
That woman was the real actor in the family.
[Carolyn] I just started working for Marv.
I went backstage to introduce myself.
And then what happened? You told me you were too tired pretending to be nice all night,  and I needed to leave you alone.
 Oh.
I'm a real jerk, huh? Yeah, but you're honest, straightforward, not fake nice and don't beat around the bush.
Your heart is tender, so you protect it from people, but sometimes you open up a wall and it's incredible.
You're doing the best you can, considering your asshole parents.
You have great taste in art, and that pink spot on your nose is just adorable.
How many nice things was that, about ten?  Yeah, just about.
 Okay, one more.
You let me help you tonight because you knew I needed it.
You did it for me, which was very sweet.
Thanks.
You're a good friend to me.
 BoJack  Yeah? Are we friends? Yeah.
I mean, I think we are.
Or I think we can be.
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you Please don't leave me.
 Princess Carolyn  Please.
I can turn this around, I just need more time.
We're in a fragile period, still finding our feet.
Just give me six months and then you can go.
I promise, I'll never ask anything from you again, but please, give me six months.
Sorry, I left my coat here.
[whistling a tune] [waiter] I got it.
[continues whistling] So? What do you think? No.
Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  I'm BoJack the Horseman  BoJack 

Ladies and gentlemen, to announce this year's Oscar nominees Mr.
Peanutbutter! Mr.
Peanutbutter! Mr.
Peanutbutter? Hello! Here I am, Mr.
Peanutbutter.
That's my name and I am here.
Okay, the nominees.
Nominees for Oscar.
Who are the nominees? Well, as I used to say on Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out, let's find out.
For Best Actor, the nominees are.
Jurj Clooners for The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.
Bread Poot for City of AIDS.
Colin Firth for First Things Firth.
The Colin Firth Story.
Michael Fassbender for I want to say Bill Gates? And BoJack Horseman for Secretariat.
Whoa.
BoJack, you just got nominated for an Oscar.
You're an Oscar nominee.
How do you feel? I feel II feel I feel the same.
It happened again.
Why do I keep thinking things will make me happy?  What is wrong with me?  BoJack, don't do this.
 Don't fetishize your own sadness.
 Uh Oh, God, I'm drowning.
 I feel like I'm drowning.
 BoJack, listen.
When I was 17, I snuck out to a fraternity party.
The roads were icy and I swerved into the lake.
I came to underwater.
It was dark and cold, and I didn't even know which way was up.
I thought for sure I was going to drown.
And then I noticed when I opened my mouth, the air bubbles floated up, and that's how I knew which way to swim.
That is a terrifying story.
BoJack, when you find yourself lost and disoriented and underwater and you don't know which way is up, it's important to breathe.
I don't deserve this.
I'm not a best actor.
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.
That's literally the only thing they're about.
No.
All this means is that you're one of the special people.
I saw it the first time I met you.
You must have known it all your life.
And all your life, people told you that you were wrong, that you weren't special, that you were just like everybody else.
But now, the special people are saying, You were right, BoJack.",Humor
You were right.,Humor
" I was right.
I am one of the special people.
 Yes.
 What are we doing just sitting here? I just got nominated for an Oscar.
We gotta party like it's 1982, the year Prince released 1999.
Whoohoo! BoJack, your complimentary Rolex is here.
BoJack, giant chocolate Oscar's here.
Famous DJ David Guetta is at the door.
Free Tesla's here, Boj.
They want to know if they can park it in your driveway.
No.
Tell them I want my free Tesla parked in my goddamn living room.
I'm BoJack! Yeah, now we're doing it! Look at us partying.
BoJack, you got another delivery.
Someone sent a nerd? Hi.
You get a load of this chili cheese fountain? Grab a handful of beans and go to town.
Hey, this is all really something.
But I actually just came because I heard about the nomination and I wanted to make sure you're okay.
That's a funny way of saying congratulations.
But not funny haha"", more like funny Doonesbury.",Humor
I know how this kind of thing can sometimes send you spinning.,Humor
"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy? Will anything make me happy? I'm an empty husk.
 That kind of thing.",Humor
"Well, thank you for that, but I'm actually doing great.",Humor
"I direct your attention to the aforementioned chili cheese fountain! It's too bad I'm not managing your social campaign anymore, because this party would make a great Snapchat story.",Humor
You are not gonna make me guilty about leaving Princess Carolyn.,Humor
I'm not here to make you feel guilty.,Humor
"Like I said Honestly, I don't even know what you're doing over there.",Humor
"Tweeting for celebrities?  Well, actually, I don't When I met you, you were so cool and interesting Uh, I was never cool.",Humor
You used to actually care about shit.,Humor
"What happened? I don't know, BoJack.",Humor
Maybe caring about shit got old.,Humor
"Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me and sending death threats to my house, and all my friends thinking I'm annoying, and getting in fights with my husband, and seeing little refugee boys die in hospital bombings.",Humor
It's exhausting and I can't do it.,Humor
"If that makes me a bad person, then I'm sorry that I'm not the ""cool, interesting girl.",Humor
" I never said you were a bad person.
I just said it's not you.
And you know it's not you.
Oh, and this party is you? Who are all these people?  These are my friends.
 Name one of them.
 Tesley.
 You're just looking at the Tesla.
I don't know why it's so hard for you to believe that I could be happy.
I'm not like you, okay?  I don't fetishize my own sadness.
 I don't fetishize my own sadness.
 Sure.
 You don't know anything about me.
Hey! I know that you can tweet for a living in a house in Beverly Hills that your husband bought, or you can think you're better than everyone, but you can't do both.
I don't think I'm better than everyone.
And again, I say, sure.
You know what's gonna happen? You're gonna win that Oscar, and you're gonna go up on that stage and give your little speech, and then you're gonna go home.
And you're gonna be so miserable, you'll want to kill yourself.
And you're gonna have nobody left to stop you.
Hey, it's BoJack! BoJack! BoJack! No one's gonna be there when I kill myself? Listen to that chanting, Diane.
The chanting don't lie.
There's going to be plenty of people around when I kill myself.
BoJack! Tell your readers that BoJack was sleeping.
He didn't even know they were announced today.
Okay.
Goodbye, Heather.
 Hey, Ana, can I ask you something?  Of course, darling.
 So, if I win the Oscar  When"" you win the Oscar.",Humor
Right.,Humor
"But after that, what's gonna happen to us?  What do you mean?  What we have.",Humor
"It's more than just an Oscar campaign, right?  I need to go.",Humor
What? There's work to be done.,Humor
"We got the nomination, but now, the real battle begins.",Humor
Enjoy your party.,Humor
Stop worrying about the future.,Humor
"Come on, buddy! Come on!  Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter!  Thank God you're okay.,Humor
Better than okay.,Humor
I'm wonderful.,Humor
"Thanks to you, you wonderful man.",Humor
"When you said my name this morning, you changed my life.",Humor
"About that  Hey, did you see Erica here? She was looking for you earlier, with her good eye.",Humor
Her other eye was looking to the stars.,Humor
"BoJack, I need to talk to you.",Humor
"Yeah? What's going on, buddy? Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news.",Humor
Raven on a wire.,Humor
"A gloomy portent, precariously perched.",Humor
"And, as the sun sets, so does it spread its deathly shadow across the just and unjust of the outdoor seating area of the California Pizza Kitchen.",Humor
Mmhmm! And what better way to view such disquieting omens than through these gorgeous floortoceiling windows? Yeah.,Humor
Wow! They really make regular windows look like shit.,Humor
"I can't look out the window while lying on the floor?  No, thank you, regular window!  Tell me a little about your company.",Humor
"Well, it started as a safe space for women.",Humor
"Ooh! Then, it became a safe space for women and men.",Humor
"Oh! Now, it's more of a safeish space for women Mmhmm.",Humor
And a really safe space for men to look at women I hear you.,Humor
While also being driven around by them.,Humor
Wow! Something for everyone.,Humor
Demand is skyrocketing.,Humor
That's why we need a bigger office space.,Humor
"You come to work, clock in, you put sugar in your coffee, and watch it slowly disappear into nothingness.",Humor
But the sugar doesn't know why.,Humor
Sugar didn't ask to be born.,Humor
Is he okay? He recently found out that his brother's sick.,Humor
Oh.,Humor
"I'm so sorry, but you know what else is sick?  These hardwood floors.",Humor
"Ooh! Did you hear that, Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter? Losing BoJack was a blow.,Humor
"There's no way to sugarcoat it, even if I were generally good at sugarcoating things, which I'm not.",Humor
"You know, I wish cats really did have nine lives.",Humor
It would make me feel better about how much I'm screwing up this one.,Humor
You're not screwing up your life.,Humor
"Sometimes I feel like, if I could start everything over, knowing what I know now, I'd do it all right this time.",Humor
"But other times I think No, I wouldn't.",Humor
"As you all know, things have been rough, and, unfortunately, we have to scale back our staff.",Humor
"Mainly, you.",Humor
"Are you firing me? In a sense, yes.",Humor
"But, in another sense, I'm promoting you to a position of finding a job somewhere else.",Humor
Yeah.,Humor
I don't think I ever thanked you for giving me this job in the first place.,Humor
It was an honor to work with you.,Humor
You were the worst social media coordinator this company ever had.,Humor
Are you sure you need surgery? Can't you get a second opinion? Second opinion? You know there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.,Humor
I could ask him twice if it'd make you feel better.,Humor
Nothing could make me feel better right now.,Humor
Not even an amazing career opportunity.,Humor
"Hold on, I'm getting another call.",Humor
I've got to take this.,Humor
It could be an amazing career opportunity.,Humor
Hello? Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp, awards show producer, with a career opportunity that is good.",Humor
"This isn't a great time, Shep.",Humor
Could you call back? Absolutely not.,Humor
The Oscar nomination announcement is in seven days and we don't have a host.,Humor
"Sadly, Jimmy Fallon just broke his face.",Humor
"What? Halloween in January? What a crazy concept! I can't believe it! I mean, what is this? Barry Gibb would be like I'm going in! No.",Humor
"First, I gotta get a selfie with this thing.",Humor
"I'm Jimmy Fallon Und you are our first choice after our first ""first choice"" got hit by a bus.",Humor
"You're our second ""first choice.",Humor
" What do you say? Ooh, a job like that? You want a fully present presenter to present.
And I don't know if I've got the pep in my step to take that show where it needs to go, you know? I've got a real pepless step, Shep.
Okay, well, let me know, because if you don't want to do it, we'll probably just post the list of nominees online or something.
It's really not that big of a deal.
Hey, sorry about that.
Just got a call from the Oscars.
 They want me to host  They want you to host the Oscars? Nomination announcement.
But I don't think I have it in me right now.
Are you kidding? You gotta take that gig.
 Really?  Mr.
Peanutbutter what did Nana Peanutbutter always say? Always take every opportunity that comes your way because opportunities are like sneezes from God, and when God sneezes, you can't say 'God bless you' to God, so instead you have to take the opportunity.",Humor
I'm cold.,Humor
"Will you pass me that blanket?"" Boy, that old gal had something for everything, didn't she? I know you're worried about me, but sitting around the house worrying isn't going to help anyone.",Humor
"Okay, but you'll call me when you get out of the surgery, right? I'm not gonna let my phone leave my sight.",Humor
Of course.,Humor
"And now, I've got something new to live for.",Humor
"My little brother, telling the whole world who got an Oscar! Nomination.",Humor
We are minutes away.,Humor
"Shep, release the envelope.",Humor
Copy that.,Humor
Releasing the envelope.,Humor
It's go time.,Humor
It's go time.,Humor
"Are you ready, Brother Pricewater?  Of course, Brother Housecoopers.",Humor
Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, we'd like to invite you to the stage.",Humor
It's here! The golden envelope.,Humor
Hmm  Herr Peanutbutter? Okay.,Humor
"Oh, my phone.",Humor
"What should I do with it, Todd?  Maybe you should hold it.",Humor
Uhhuh.,Humor
"No, I'll take it with me.",Humor
All right.,Humor
"No, you hold it.",Humor
"Sure thing, yeah.",Humor
"No, put it in my jacket pocket.",Humor
Right here.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
"Oh, no, it's a fake pocket.",Humor
"Tricked again! Todd, it's ringing.",Humor
This is it.,Humor
"Oh, no, my phone! Oh, no, I kicked it, right through that doorway into the hallway! Now, other people are kicking it and it's sliding across the floor!  Okay, this is getting absurd.",Humor
Let's get that phone! Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, you have been invited to the stage!  Excuse me!  Hey! Sorry.",Humor
"If you could just My phone! I'm coming to get you! That way! Come on, phone.",Humor
Just stop!  Hello?  Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter.,Humor
"I just, um I wanted to give you a chance to say goodbye  Oh, no.",Humor
to my twisted spleen.,Humor
"Because it was successfully removed from my body! Oh, my God, that's incredible! Now, get out there and announce those Oscars! Nominations.",Humor
"You got it, buddy.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
"Now, where's the the Uhoh.",Humor
Could've sworn it was right here.,Humor
Oh! Oh! There you are.,Humor
You need to get on stage.,Humor
"Yes, just as soon as you give me that backup envelope, please and por favor.",Humor
What backup envelope? There is no backup envelope.,Humor
That was a test and you passed.,Humor
Wunderbar.,Humor
"Now, let's get you out there.",Humor
"Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage, to announce the nominations.",Humor
"Just as soon as I Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper? Bradley Cooper? We love him for some reason.",Humor
"Where?  Let's go, Todd.",Humor
"Oh, God, what do we do?  It's okay.",Humor
We just need to come up with all the nominees ourselves.,Humor
But I haven't even seen all the movies.,Humor
"Todd, nobody has.",Humor
That's not how they give out awards.,Humor
But  Time for talk is over.,Humor
Now's the time for action.,Humor
"And by ""action,"" I mean talking about these 24 categories until we've settled on a list of nominees.",Humor
"You need to tell me right now, are you in or out? Well, when you put it that way, I guess you can call me highwaisted denim, because, right now, I am very in.",Humor
Let's do this.,Humor
What did you think of Frieda Pinto? Are you kidding me? Anybody could do what she did.,Humor
"Don't take my baby.
I'll give you all my Bitcoins! Wow.",Humor
That is good.,Humor
"Okay, for Best Picture, what about Avatar?  That was a good movie.",Humor
"True, but did that come out this year?  I feel like I just saw it.",Humor
"Well, there's no way to know for sure.",Humor
Let's just throw it on the list.,Humor
"Ooh, do we have Daniel DayLewis down for anything? He's always there.",Humor
Good catch! I'll add him.,Humor
Daniel DayLewis.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
We need one more nominee for Best Actor.,Humor
"Oh, what about BoJack? His performance in Secretariat was as thoughtful and selfaware as we've ever seen him.",Humor
"Besides, he's our friend.",Humor
"Is he? Whoa! I am surprised to hear you say that, Todd Chavez.",Humor
Let's dig into that.,Humor
We have time.,Humor
I don't think we do.,Humor
"You're supposed to be announcing these, like, now.",Humor
There is always time to talk about our feelings.,Humor
"As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say, ""There's always time to talk about feelings, because feelings are the ceilings of our hearts, and a leaky feeling ceiling leads to a flood of blood.",Humor
And I'm cold.,Humor
"Will you pass me that blanket?"" Well, I guess I'm just tired of BoJack walking all over everybody and still getting everything he wants.",Humor
"Mmhmm, mmhmm.",Humor
"I think the important thing to remember here is that BoJack is a damaged individual, struggling against a sea of demons, many selfcreated, but still all too real.",Humor
Getting this nomination from the two friends he loves the most you and also me would really mean a lot to him.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
"But did you really think he was that good in the movie? Oh, I haven't seen it.",Humor
It seemed long.,Humor
And the final nominee for Best Picture is Avatar.,Humor
"Well, those are all the nominations.",Humor
I will not be taking any questions.,Humor
Goodbye.,Humor
I must go.,Humor
"I gotta say, we picked some topnotch noms.",Humor
"You know it! Boy, was I glad when we got out of that theater, though.",Humor
I know.,Humor
So many questions.,Humor
"Oh, what the hell happened? Why were you reading off that napkin? Why are you guys running? They have their nominees.",Humor
"What more could they want? You know what's crazy? We saved the day today, and no one will ever even know.",Humor
"Hey, we'll know.",Humor
Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, we know what you did.",Humor
"Oh, boy.",Humor
"So, the good news is, my brother's surgery was a success.",Humor
"And the bad news is, you're not nominated for an Oscar.",Humor
And the other good news is that each breath is a gift and it is a joy to live.,Humor
What?  We are so lucky we get to be alive.,Humor
"No, before that.",Humor
"Oh, I didn't tell you.",Humor
My brother's been sick.,Humor
"No, I don't care about your brother.",Humor
"First of all, manners.",Humor
"Second of all, I think if you met him, you'd actually really hit it off.",Humor
"Imagine me but with less ""in your face"" cool guy attitude.",Humor
"Did you say I'm not nominated for an Oscar? Oh A lot of people are mighty steamed, but I feel like what everyone's overlooking here is, I got most of the categories deadon.",Humor
"That's pretty amazing, and I am not getting enough credit for that.",Humor
Did you know that Avatar came out in 2009?  I'm not nominated for an Oscar.,Humor
No.,Humor
But you know what they say.,Humor
"It's an honor just to be nominated.
 Oh, wait.",Humor
"So, I'm just like everybody else.",Humor
"I know you're upset, but whatever you do, please don't get mad at Todd.",Humor
Why would I get mad at Todd?  Exactly.,Humor
This is totally my fault.,Humor
He didn't even want to nominate you.,Humor
"What? With the gift of hindsight, I see now how that might have made you even more upset.",Humor
"But I realized something today, when my brother called from the hospital, and I think it's gonna make you feel a lot better.",Humor
What? What is it?  None of this matters.,Humor
"Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.",Humor
"As a partner in the company, I am prepared to forgo my salary for the next three months, but even then, we're going to need some sort of miracle.",Humor
What are we doing? What was the point of any of this? I wasted everyone's time for six months.,Humor
"Soon, I'll get some offer from one of the big five agencies that I can't say no to, and I'll go back to being another cog in the giant PlayDoh spaghetti maker that is this industry.",Humor
Is that the best I can hope for?  Not necessarily.,Humor
"Although, there is one thing I should probably mention.",Humor
"What is it, Judah? Maybe this is an opportunity to live one of your other eight lives.",Humor
"Yeah, maybe.",Humor
"It's been a pleasure working with you, Judah.",Humor
I found it to be an above average experience.,Humor
Please forgive me for getting emotional.,Humor
"Rye, wheat, or sourdough? Can I get it on stale? And then, he said, I fetishize my own sadness.",Humor
What did you think was gonna happen? Why did you go there? I don't know.,Humor
Did you ask for water?  No.,Humor
They're not supposed to give us water unless we ask.,Humor
"Don't they know there's a drought?  You want to send the water back? No, I want the water.",Humor
I just I went to BoJack's house to congratulate him.,Humor
I'm not trying to pick fights.,Humor
"Well, you don't have to see him at all if you don't want to.",Humor
It's not like you work for him anymore.,Humor
"Is he right? Am I a bad person?  Who cares what he thinks? Why do you have this weird fixation with him? I do not have a fixation, Roxy.",Humor
I worry about him.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
"And last year? When you came back from Cordovia and needed a place to crash? Oh, you could have stayed with me, or any of your other friends, but you went right to his house.",Humor
Did you ever ask yourself why? They're filling everyone's glasses.,Humor
This is insane.,Humor
"Oh, my God.",Humor
"What do you care? Hey, excuse me? Excuse me? Do you know you're breaking the law by giving everybody water? It's okay.",Humor
I want the water.,Humor
"Yeah, we all want water.",Humor
That's not the point.,Humor
"In the state of California, it is illegal for a restaurant to serve people water before they ask for it.",Humor
There is a drought.,Humor
"Sit down! We're thirsty! You know, this is what's wrong with society.",Humor
Diane Nobody thinks about the world outside themselves.,Humor
"So, how you doing? You still working at that place?  Hello?  Hi, Ralph.",Humor
It's Princess Carolyn.,Humor
"Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn, I never thought I'd hear from you again.",Humor
I might have some free time coming up.,Humor
I was wondering if you might want to get a drink.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
"So, the night I met you after I said goodbye, the craziest thing happened.",Humor
"Okay? I was walking back to my car, when all of a sudden,  this woman  Oh.",Humor
"Tripped on a cobblestone, twisted her ankle,  and tumbled into my arms.",Humor
"What? Turns out, she was a ballerina, and she didn't speak a word of English.",Humor
"So, I rushed her to the hospital, and long story short, we eloped.",Humor
Oh.,Humor
"I moved to Russia, and I'm totally messing with you.",Humor
None of that's true.,Humor
What? I would love to see you again.,Humor
I think about you all the time.,Humor
Really?  Yeah.,Humor
How about this Saturday? It's a date.,Humor
"Ana? Uh, no, it's just me, giant chocolate Oscar guy.",Humor
I'm here to pick up the giant chocolate Oscar.,Humor
My boss really wants our product to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.,Humor
"You know, to maintain the integrity of the giant chocolate Oscar.",Humor
I don't care.,Humor
Take it.,Humor
You've reached Ana Spanakopita.,Humor
How did you get this number? Explain yourself.,Humor
"Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.",Humor
Please call me back.,Humor
I need you.,Humor
"Ana, please.",Humor
"This is BoJack, by the way.",Humor
Horseman.,Humor
"Hey! Todd! Where you been?  Oh, hi.",Humor
"You were in Ojai?  No, I was just saying hi.",Humor
"Well, why not go to Ojai, huh? You and me? I could use an escape, couldn't you? It's not really a good time.",Humor
"Todd, I need this.",Humor
You're my best friend and I need you.,Humor
Don't leave me now.,Humor
Don't be like everybody else.,Humor
I'm not leaving you.,Humor
"I just Besides, I think you owe me, right? After what you did?  What I did?  Come on, Todd.",Humor
I know.,Humor
Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter told me everything.,Humor
"Everything? Even told you, when I was a kid, I used to bang on my butt like a bongo drum  when I got out of the bath?  What? Toddo, me and Toddo Bath time come Make Todd shiny and clean Mm, no, notnot about that.",Humor
"So, he didn't tell you everything.",Humor
"Did he tell you about the time I counted to a million? One, two, three, four, five, six  No, stop.",Humor
But I was just getting to the good part! What? Seven? He told me you didn't want to nominate me for an Oscar.,Humor
"Oh, that.",Humor
"What the hell, man?  After everything I've done for you?  What are you talking about? Oh, I don't know.",Humor
"Letting you live here for free for six years? Giving you food, indulging you in your little projects and adventures and stories about how you used to bang on your butt like a bongo drum? I let you turn my house into your company's headquarters for the last month.",Humor
"Yeah, but that's not because you're my friend.",Humor
That's because you felt bad about Emily.,Humor
You know about Emily? I think I know.,Humor
"Why? What do you think I know? I mean, I know what I think, but I don't know if the thing that I think is the thing that you think I know.",Humor
"You know?  So, you know I had sex with Emily.",Humor
"You had sex with Emily?!  Well, what did you think?  I don't know! Not that! I just knew something sketchy happened.",Humor
"I thought maybe you gave her one of your weird monologues about how sad you are, and it bummed her out! Todd, I'm sorry, all right? I screwed up.",Humor
I know I screwed up.,Humor
"I don't know why Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes! You can't keep doing this! You can't keep doing shitty things, and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay! You need to be better! I know.",Humor
"And I'm sorry, okay? I was drunk, and there was all this pressure with the Oscar campaign.",Humor
"But now Now that it's over, I  No! No, BoJack, just stop.",Humor
You are all the things that are wrong with you.,Humor
"It's not the alcohol, or the drugs, or any of the shitty things that happened to you in your career, or when you were a kid.",Humor
It's you.,Humor
All right? It's you.,Humor
"Fuck, man.",Humor

 How's life? Well, the truth is that Didn't catch that, but everything's cool? No.
In fact, I've never felt so alone Sorry, missed it! You should learn to talk louder, dude! Oh, hey, bummer about you getting the nomination, but then, it turning out that you didn't get the nomination.
It was big news yesterday.
Yeah, I got royally screwed, know who was there for me? No one, because everyone's an asshole and the whole world sucks balls.
 Anyway, thanks for having me over.
 I'm with you, man.
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.
Why would I make my body a temple? I've been to Temple.
Temple is super boring.
What do you say we go on an epic bender? Yes! Let's get higher than a stilt walker's dick! That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get some booze and drugs.
We can clear out my bank account.
I got nothing left I care about.
What do you mean get""? This whole house is booze and drugs.",Humor
Here.,Humor
Yogurtcovered raisins?  Nope.,Humor
Vicodincovered Vicodin.,Humor
Oh!  LSD.,Humor
Wow.,Humor
Yah! Crystal meth.,Humor
Haha! Eeyah! [snorting] Cocaine No! That's drywall.,Humor
"Ugh! Where the hell did I hide the cocaine? Oh, yeah, I also told the liquor store to deliver.",Humor
[grunting] To nine months of sobriety.,Humor
"To life and being done with it! [both laughing] Okay, okay.",Humor
"What about this one? Remember when Erika Eleniak guest starred as Goober's cousin from out of town, and Brad had a boner for the whole episode?  What? No.",Humor
You can totally see it in every scene.,Humor
"Cold open, boner! Act one, boner! Commercial break ""Hello, we're from the Wheaties corporation!"" Back to boners! Okay, we'll put it on the list.",Humor
We gotta watch that one.,Humor
"What about the one where the writers made Joelle dress up like a pumpkin, and the whole episode was fat jokes, so then Joelle got an eating disorder? Everything was so much simpler back then.",Humor
She had to go to a clinic.,Humor
"She missed, like, five episodes.",Humor
We didn't know how good we had it.,Humor
"We got to come to work and have fun every day, and we weren't worried about our legacy or awards.",Humor
"Because buildings are supposed to be rectangles, goddamn it! Wait, what were we talking about? We were talking about Horsin' Around.",Humor
"Then, you had to go pee.",Humor
"Then, you came back covered in toilet paper and pretended to be a mummy.",Humor
"Then, you took it all off because you decided Egypt was stupid, especially pyramids, because you think triangle buildings are, and I quote, ""gauche as shit.",Humor
" That does sound like me, but I don't remember any of that.
I must have blacked out.
Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for and I said, You're sitting on the pizza, Mr.",Humor
President.,Humor
"  Whoa! I think I just had another one.
 Another what? Pizza? No, blackout.
The thing we were just talking about.
 Try to keep up here.
 Oh Boom! Boner! Pay up! What did I tell you? That's not a boner.
It's a shadow.
Well, I think we all learned a valuable lesson today about the Armenian genocide.
The Armenian genocide was too much, man! [audience laughing] All right! Next episode.
Why can't life be like it was on Horsin' Around? All our issues conveniently settled in 22 hilarious minutes.
You know, it's amazing that it's legal for kids to be actors.
How is that not child labor? I didn't know what I was signing up for.
 I was three.
 This is getting me depressed.
Let's do something fun.
Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass? The planetarium! You get crazy high in the parking lot, then you go in and get your mind blown by all the trippy galaxies and shit.
That sounds stupid.
I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.
[snorting] No, no, no! That was drywall.
Jesus, we have to start marking our drugs more clearly.
Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.
Whoo!  [male voice] It was just so hard.
 Wha? What the? I was stuck in a terrifying cycle of drinking, lifting my head up, drinking, lifting my head up, drinking, lifting my head up.
Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogs telling boring stories about themselves?  Jesus! Are we at a 12step meeting?  Now, you're a detective? Last night, you couldn't even solve the mystery of where the toilet is.
So, all our partying was an elaborate trick just to get me to go sober? No, Detective Pukes in the Washing Machine.
You're here because I couldn't leave you alone in my house, and I had to come today.
Gotta get my ninemonth chip.
Chip? We've been wasted for 31 hours? That's no reason for me to not get my chip.
That's literally exactly the reason you shouldn't get your chip.
Nowhere in the 12 steps does it say to not drink.
That's not actually one of the steps.
Loophole.
Take a swig.
If you have to listen to losers talk about their shitty sober lives, it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.
And I realized people don't change because they want to change.
They change because they have to change.
Oh, God.
Boo! Oh, booing is generally frowned upon here.
How else am I supposed to express how boring these stories are? [speaking slowly] My name is Simon and I'm an alcoholic.
[all] Hi, Simon.
My rock bottom was when I actually woke up under a rock.
Can't get lower than that.
Come on! You people call yourself drunks? Most of this is stuff I do on a daily basis completely sober.
Trust me, pal, we've done some awful things.
One time, I didn't want my friend to move out, so I used character actress Ann Dowd to help me sabotage his hiphopera.
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.
You socalled drunks want something to feel shitty about?  BoJack, maybe we should go.
 I got somethin' for ya.
Whoa.
My name is BoJack.
[all] Hi, BoJack.
Oh, like you didn't know? Anyway, I once went all the way down to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew, and she had a young daughter, Penny.
Penny Carson.
That's her real name.
You can look her up.
I don't care.
And first, I tried to sleep with the mom, but she said no.
 Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.
 [all groaning] Then, the mom walked in on me trying to sleep with the daughter, and I was like, Oopsiedoopsie! Exit stage right!"" Oh, God.",Humor
"The worst part is, I don't even know what happened after I left.",Humor
Did I ruin the family? Did I scar that little girl for life? I don't know.,Humor
I'll never know.,Humor
"And that's just, like, one of a billion things that I have going through my head all the time.",Humor
"So, anyone got a better story than that? Wow.",Humor
"Didn't think so, bitches.",Humor
"Where's my trophy, or chip, or whatever?  [screams]  [car horn honking]  Whoa!  [screams] [tires squealing] That was impressive, BoJack.",Humor
I've never seen them cancel an AA meeting because everyone got bummed out before.,Humor
"Uh, what are you talking about? You told everyone about that Penny chick.",Humor
"Then, you went on and on about how you're never going to change.",Humor
"Then, you chased the slug around, threatening to pour salt on his head.",Humor
I talked about Penny? Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.,Humor
[tires squealing]  [loud crash] Most of us aren't as proud of it as you seem to be.,Humor
I'm not proud.,Humor
I feel really terrible that I might have really messed that girl up.,Humor
"Oh, she's fine.",Humor
I looked her up on Facebook.,Humor
"She's going to Oberlin, likes Thai food and the smell of a fire on the first really cold day of winter.",Humor
That doesn't mean anything.,Humor
Everyone likes the smell of fire on the first cold day of winter.,Humor
"You know, I used to feel just like you before I got into this ""12 steps"" thing.",Humor
They taught me how to make amends.,Humor
You just say you're sorry for the things you did and you get a clean slate.,Humor
"So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.",Humor
"Then, you just make amends again.",Humor
"It's a neverending cycle, where you always end up feeling good about yourself.",Humor
"[man] No!  You know what? This may be the nitrous and bath salts talking, but I want to do some more nitrous and bath salts.",Humor
"[tires squealing]  [crash] And then, let's make some goddamn amends.",Humor
Maybe you should start with the family whose playhouse you just smashed.,Humor
"[crying] Oh, no!  Oh.",Humor
"Hey, kid! I'm sorry your lame dad built such a cheapass playhouse! Yeah, you gotta use parallel joints to support that foundation, dumbshit!  Also, suck a dick!  You know what? I do feel better.",Humor
[laughing]  [crying] [doorbell ringing]  I don't think they're home.,Humor
"So, we wait.",Humor
"I need to make amends to Diane, and we're not leaving until I do.",Humor
"[sighs] But it's boring out here, and I'm hungry and I'm bored! I bet they have food inside.",Humor
Let's see if I still have that spare key.,Humor
Here it is.,Humor
"[grunts]  Yes! Okay, after we get food, remind me that this is another thing I need to make amends for.",Humor
"[sighs, burps] Where are those two? They did not keep their fridge stocked enough for two stoned people waiting around for hours.",Humor
"It's only been, like, ten minutes.",Humor
You have a real thing with food.,Humor
"That's what happens when you mix the appetite of a horse with the appetite of someone with a hole inside him that needs to be constantly filled with attention, food, and sex.",Humor
Pass the Bugles.,Humor
There's no more Bugles.,Humor
There's no more of anything.,Humor
Let's just go.,Humor
I can't leave until I make amends.,Humor
[gasps] I got a idea! My name is BoJack's friend What'sHerFace and I wear glasses.,Humor
"Do you have something to say to me, BoJack?  Am I BoJack or Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter?  You can be anyone you want.,Humor
This is your dream dream dream Stop doing that.,Humor
We're both awake.,Humor
Let's just get to this.,Humor
"Diane, I'm sorry I said mean things to you.",Humor
That's cool.,Humor
I forgive you.,Humor
"Wait, would my character say that? What's Diane's deal again? She's, like, an Asian Daria?  She's a little more complex.",Humor
"But she's basically Asian Daria, right? With the glasses and the jacket and her whole ""blah"" thing.",Humor
"Okay, shut up.",Humor
"Now, I'll be Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter and you make amends to me.,Humor
Who's Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter? And, now, you be Mr.",Humor
Carolyn and I'll be Princess Diana.,Humor
"Oh, yeah.",Humor
Good idea.,Humor
"[both grunting] Um should we do something about this? Hey, why don't you two sleep this off in our guest room? Oh, my God, that mirror is talking to us! You can't stop us, us from the future!  We're making amends, assholes!  [screaming] [both groan] Ow! Come on!  That felt so good!  See? When you make amends, don't you just feel lighter? Well, I also ate a shit ton of Bugles, so no.",Humor
But I do feel like we got to the bottom of who really killed Princess Di.,Humor
It was all of us.,Humor
"Next stop, Todd! Todd, I'm sorry.",Humor
"I want to take full responsibility for what happened, even though it is not my fault and I did nothing wrong.",Humor
Emily is an adult woman who can make her own choices.,Humor
"And besides, are you even really into girls?  I mean, what is your deal?  Uh  Hey, what are you doing with our son?  Uh Wait, you're BoJack Horseman.",Humor
"I am, and this is my best buddy Todd.",Humor
[grunts] That movie star has really taken a shine to our boy.,Humor
"You think this is our big break? You don't think he's inappropriately interested, do you? What? No.",Humor
"But if he is, that could also be a big break.",Humor
I'm just saying.,Humor
"[groans]  [stammering]  Hey, wait!  Hold on.",Humor
Where are you going?  Come back.,Humor
"You want to take Todd for a sleepover?  Sleepover?  No offense, Todd, but your parents are creeping me out.",Humor
"To the next amends! [screaming] [grunting]  What do you want, BoJack?  I don't know.",Humor
"I'm very drunk and a little nauseous, but if I'm here in your house, it must be to make amends.",Humor
Amends for what?  I don't know.,Humor
Whatever it is that you think I did to make you disappear.,Humor
"BoJack  How could you leave me like that when I needed you most? I'm sorry, BoJack.",Humor
I thought you were a winner.,Humor
I was wrong.,Humor
"This is hard for me, too.",Humor
"I staked my reputation No, this is not about the Oscar campaign.",Humor
"How could you think that this is about the Oscar campaign? We had something more, didn't we?  You've been drinking.",Humor
"Well, not just drinking.",Humor
"[snorting] Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.",Humor
"Whoa! I am a broken, screwedup misfit toy, and you act all in control, but I know that, deep down, you're broken, too.",Humor
And I don't know why you won't just give us a chance to be broken together.,Humor
"What about that doesn't appeal to you? [sighs] BoJack, when I was in college, I had a job as a lifeguard Wait, did we just go to Ana's house? Did I get closure? If by ""closure"" you mean I lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.",Humor
We gotta go back.,Humor
"What the hell?  I know I was just here, but I feel like you told me some important story that explained everything about us.",Humor
"Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.",Humor
Gotta be honest.,Humor
I've had a couple beers.,Humor
"Ugh! All right, I'll tell you again, if it'll make you leave.",Humor
"When I was a lifeguard, I  Oh, crud.",Humor
"You want to go back to Ana's, don't you? I feel like I'll definitely get it this time.",Humor
Lifeguard  One more time?  No.,Humor
This time I wrote it down.,Humor
"I'm a lifeguard.
This woman's house smells weird, or is that me? Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.
Don't do that thing where you write down your thoughts instead of what the person is actually saying.
I wonder if it's time to get my boobs done again.
  Mmhmm.",Humor
[inhales] That's very helpful.,Humor
Thank you.,Humor
"Who's next? I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [sighs] [door sliding closed] Okay, so I know I keep bothering you tonight.",Humor
Tonight? I haven't seen you in two weeks.,Humor
"Oh, really? I just need to know what you were trying to tell me about being a lifeguard, and then, I'll leave and you'll never see me again.",Humor
"Mmm After I almost drowned, I decided I would never again be weaker than water.",Humor
"So, I became a lifeguard.",Humor
"On my first day of training, my instructor told me that there are going to be times when you'll see someone in trouble.",Humor
"You're going to want to rush in there and do whatever you can to save them, but you have to stop yourself, because there are some people you can't save.",Humor
Cause those people will thrash and struggle and try to take you down with them.,Humor
What does that have to do with me? What the? Where the hell are we now?  Ohi  Ojai?  We drove all the way to Ojai?  Let me finish.,Humor
"Ohi, and here's the kicker O.",Humor
Ohio.,Humor
"We drove all the way to Ohio?! I wanted to go to the planetarium, but you demanded we come here.",Humor
"You said you had to make one more amend, to that Penny girl.",Humor
What? No! That is a terrible idea.,Humor
Let's turn this car around right now.,Humor
[tires squealing] Uh  I feel we didn't turn the car around.,Humor
"No, we did, but then, you turned it back around because you really wanted to find that deer girl, so we decided to do a stakeout.",Humor
"There was a whole makeover sequence, where we went to the mall and tried on different trench coats for each other.",Humor
Do you not remember any of that? This is insane.,Humor
I already scarred her for life.,Humor
"If I see her again, I'll just end up getting my horribleness all over her.",Humor
You think it's too late for me to go to college? I always wanted to be an architect.,Humor
"But one of those architects, where, at night, she's a highend call girl, and, by day, she's an international superspy.",Humor
"So, when is she an architect?  I don't know.",Humor
"Frontier times? No, I didn't mean what era.",Humor
"If she's a call girl at night and a spy during the day  Hey, look, Penny.",Humor
"Oh, God, what's she doing?  Does she look emotionally damaged?  She's just going to the computer.",Humor
She's probably in a sex chat room with some middleaged horse because that's the only way she can still feel love.,Humor
"Yeah, probably.",Humor
Or she's so upset about what you did that she's using the Internet to find ways to commit suicide.,Humor
That makes even more sense.,Humor
"All right, we've established that you ruined her.",Humor
Can we go back to L.,Humor
A.,Humor
now?  Yes.,Humor
"So obviously, I wanted to keep following Penny because I'm an idiot.",Humor
Let's just nip this in the bud.,Humor
"I'm gonna write ""Do not follow Penny"" on my hands in the unlikely scenario of my blacking out again.",Humor
"I'll just write ""Follow Penny"" on this hand, and then, on this hand, I'll write  Goddamn it!  What? We're just doing what the hand said.",Humor
"[groans]  Uh, what?  The hand demanded donuts.",Humor
[gasps] There she is.,Humor
She's drinking beer.,Humor
"Oh, God, this is just like the episode of Horsin' Around when Olivia went to the frat party, but Penny doesn't have a kind angel played by Jose Canseco to help her get out of this jam! Ugh.",Humor
"Okay, now, I'm bored again.",Humor
Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.,Humor
She's just drinking Red Bull.,Humor
Wait.,Humor
"Now, she's leaving.",Humor
"[both gasp]  Hey, look, it's the Obertones! Love your sound, dudes!  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you! She seems fine.",Humor
"Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secret that's eating away at her soul.",Humor
"Or, possibly she's fine.",Humor
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.,Humor
"Hey, you were a father figure, who was sexually inappropriate to me, and I turned out perfect.",Humor
"Now, can we please go home?  Okay, good plan.",Humor
I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.,Humor
Whoa.,Humor
"Look at me, walking good.",Humor
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",Humor
"[all screaming melodically] No, no, no! Shush, shush.",Humor
"BoJack?  Oh!  What are you doing here?  Hey, Penny!  Did you come here to find me?  No, I You can't be here.",Humor
II don't want to see you here.,Humor
I don't want to see you at all.,Humor
I was 17.,Humor
I didn't know any better.,Humor
I tried  You need to leave.,Humor
"It's BoJack Horseman and Sarah Lynn! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! BoJack, we need to get out of here now.",Humor
"Can I get a selfie and another selfie if the first selfie doesn't look good?  [overlapping chatter]  BoJack, over here! Penny, no.",Humor
"Penny? You know, on the plus side, she really seemed okay.",Humor
Mmhmm.,Humor
Until she saw you and freaked out.,Humor
[groans] But she probably would have been totally fine if you'd never shown up.,Humor
"Oh, God.",Humor
I think the wound was completely healed before you reopened it by showing up unannounced at her college and all the pain came rushing back to her.,Humor
"Oh, good Lord! In a way, it's like you destroyed her life twice.",Humor
"Will you please stop talking about it?  Okay, fine.",Humor
Whoop.,Humor
"[shivers] Man, Ohio sucks! Next time, could you almost molest someone who lives in Hawaii? You could be bummed out at a luau right now.",Humor
Let's just go home.,Humor
You got a bottle opener?  Glove compartment.,Humor
"Well, I'll be a dick sucked by a dumbshit! What do we have here? Oh, that? Turns out there's a brand of heroin called BoJack.",Humor
"Dude, that's a big freaking deal.",Humor
Getting a drug named after you is cooler than getting an Oscar.,Humor
"I mean, there's Billy Crystal Meth, Angel Dustin Hoffman, Lucille Eightball and now you.",Humor
"It's a rarefied breed, man.",Humor
"Congratulations!  Thank you?  Oh, we have to do BoJack!  It's too perfect.",Humor
I don't know.,Humor
There's that old saying.,Humor
"Liquor before beer, never fear.
Don't do heroin.
 ""I'm BoJack.",Humor
"Please, put me inside you.",Humor
" I'm not gonna shoot heroin with you, Sarah Lynn.
We can snort heroin like sophisticated adults.
Way ahead of you.
[both snorting, sighing] [moaning] Okay, thank you.
Happy Thanksgiving 2007.
Why did you just say what year it is? I guess I just get nervous talking to network executives.
This last episode got the worst ratings yet.
I was afraid your character trying heroin would be a bridge too far.
 Oh.
 And the disjointed blackout structure, with the one flashback in the middle, really confused our audience.
Yeah.
They hated all the fourthwallbreaking meta jokes.
Of course.
Audiences hate meta jokes.
When will comedy writers learn? BoJack, I know there is an audience out there for our show.
We just need to find a way to get more people to check us out.
I know what you're thinking Full frontal.
I was thinking guest star.
We need a celebrity who is incredibly popular right now, like  Oh, what about Sarah Lynn?  Ooh, that's genius! Sarah Lynn? I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her in years.
Besides, she's not gonna want to do this.
She's the world's biggest pop star.
She's the only hope we have to keep this show alive.
Would you ask her? I'm sure she'd do it for you.
You're like a father to her.
[screams, groans] [moaning]  So, what is it?  What is what? You were mumbling about how you had to ask me something.
Oh! Um, never mind.
Hey, how long have we known each other?  Feels like our entire lives.
 Well, my entire life, pretty much.
We were on a TV show.
Isn't that insane? Yeah, it's pretty wild.
You know, sometimes it feels like you're the only one who really understands me, because how could anyone else? Nobody knows what we went through, nobody who wasn't on that show.
But we knew each other before we were anybody, and that's how we can be friends, because we're not like those other people.
The people who glom onto you because of who they think you are, and they think they can sleep on your couch and eat your food.
They think you're gonna save their agency.
I never asked for that kind of pressure, but you and me, we don't want anything from each other.
You know, I I could never figure out what love meant, but, right now, I don't need to figure out anything.
I just feel it.
I love you, Sarah Lynn.
 [siren blaring in distance]  Sarah Lynn?  Sarah Lynn?  What?  Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay!  I'm not okay.
I'm bored.
This hotel room is boring! [sighs] What's on TV?  [gasps] The Oscars are on.
 Really?  How long have we been on this bender?  I love the Oscars.
The red carpet, the fashion, all the magic of Hollywoo wrapped up in one exciting night.

Can you just tell her BoJack's here? Horseman.
I'm an old friend.
Well, I'll tell her, but [groaning] [Sarah Lynn] BoJack? Oh, my God! Bring him in!  I can't believe you came to my concert.
 It was incredible.
When you sang that one ballad and shot fireworks out of your boobs, that was such a moving tribute to gays in the military.
We are going out.
Before you go, I need you to sign these posters.
It's for charity.
Doctors Without Posters.
Okay.
BoJack, can you hang out for a minute?  Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
 Also, we have those radio records, and you're doing the print ads for Sarah Lynn's Stank, the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.
 You mean Calvin Klein.
 Kevin Kline, BoJack.
He's the only man who truly understands my fragrance.
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.
Oh, my God.
Being famous is the worst.
 Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
 No, but, like, really famous.
 Uh  How can I explain it to someone like you? I feel like all my friends only like me because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.
 Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
 Who's Sarah Lipschitz? The lawyer who helped me change my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.
Oof! It is so great to see a real friend who knew me before I got huge and isn't just trying to get something out of me.
Right.
I swear you are, like, the only one I have left.
I am this close to falling off the deep end.
[laughs] I know I'm smiling right now, but the light inside me is dying.
Uh, what? But here I am blahblahblahing about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.
What is going on with you? Well, actually, I'm doing this new show, The BoJack Horseman Show.
 I don't know if you've seen it or  Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.
Yeah, no, of course, no, but it's been a lot of fun.
The ratings aren't great, but we have this upcoming episode, and we're looking for a really big guest star.
Oh.
You want me to be on your show? Well, I just thought it would be really fun for the both of us.
You know, like the old days.
I have the script with me if you want to take a look at it.
Um, okay.
Why don't you put it on that pile over there? And I'll get to it when I have some free time.
 Over here?  Yeah.
I'd love to keep hanging out, but these doctors need their posters, and I'm already pretty exhausted.
You should probably go.
 Oh, okay.
 It's all very exhausting.
Thanks again for coming.

" Again, for those just joining us, actress and pop star Sarah Lynn is dead at 31.
Day 75 at sea, there's a darkness brewing on the horizon.
I feel it.
What say you, skippy? [Todd's voice] I think you got a touch of the ocean madness, Margo.
And I think you got a real smart mouth.
You want another night in the box? No, anything but that! Then quit your yappin' and fix Mama a Sazerac.
Hey, is that character actress Margo Martindale? She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list and the AV Club's list of 20 actresses that always make everything better.
 We gotta call this in, right?  That depends.
Are we professional blimp pilots, or are we casting directors? Blimp pilots, sir.
Then we're not being paid to discover underutilized character actresses.
We're being paid to pilot this blimp.
Hey, Margo, do you see something out there across the water? Yeah.
What is that? [choking] [horn blaring] [British accent] All clear from here to Los Angeles.
[British accent] We've hit a few delays, but you'll get your precious cargo by tomorrow.

Oh, I see how it is.
Wanna play a game of chicken, huh? I don't think this is a good idea, Margo.
Cram it, skip! Those limp dicks are about to find out what savvy film and television viewers have known for years.
Character actress Margo Martindale ain't afraid of nothin'! The boats are about to collide! We have to do something! You know damn well, when we took to the sky, we made a solemn oath never to meddle in the affairs of land nor sea.
We are sworn but to observe.
This is the blimper's promise.
Oh, no! The boats are tearing each other apart! Crates and crates of spaghetti are pouring out into the ocean! I'm watching the same boat collision you are.
You don't need to narrate it.
[screaming] Oh! No! Skippy! He was too pure for this world! Oh, no! The pasta is cooking! If only we had some olive oil to reduce the stickiness.
But olive oil doesn't actually reduce the stickiness in pasta.
That's only a myth.
No! I've wasted so much of my life stirring olive oil into pasta! Disaster al dente off the coast of San Clemente! Twelve tons of pasta have leaked into the ocean, and the massive carbo load is heading straight to Pacific Ocean City.
[screaming] Joining us via Google Hangout is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.
 What can you tell us, Carla?  Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks, it will expand, smothering the town and tenderly broiling the sea life who reside there.
Is there any way to prevent this delicioussounding environmental catastrophe? The only hope for rescue would be if someone had an enormous quantity of spaghetti strainers just sitting around the house, but that person would also need access to a fleet of drivers to transport said spaghetti strainers, and in order to strain the spaghetti fast enough, the drivers would also need to be incredibly strong swimmers, like, just as an example, hot, sexy killer whales.
Is there such a savior who could possibly fit that ridiculously specific set of criteria? I don't know, Tom, but as they used to say on my favorite TV show, let's find out.
A movie, during the day? Dare I? One for Secretariat, please!  [barks]  Thank you.

 BoJack  I come from poison.
I have poison inside me, and I destroy everything I touch.
That's my legacy.
I have nothing to show for the life that I've lived, and I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me.
 That isn't true.
 Isn't it, though? [sighs] When I was a kid, I used to watch you on TV.
And you know I didn't have the best family.
Things weren't that great for me.
But, for half an hour every week, I got to watch this show about four people who had nobody, who came together and became a family.
And, for half an hour every week, I had a home, and it helped me survive.
BoJack, there are millions of people who are better off for having known you.
Why did you never tell me that? I guess to preserve some fiction of journalistic objectivity.
 Like that's a thing.
 I know you don't want to hear this, but you're too good to be writing Instagram captions for celebrities.
 I'm not just  I'm sorry, but you are.
 You know you are.
 Okay.
Thank you.
And I wish you didn't get so distant after you moved out.
 I'm sorry.

I need a show like Horsin' Around.
Okay, but this isn't like last time, is it? Where you say you want to do it, but then, I find out you don't actually want to do it, and then, your mean publicist yells at me?

Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press, and you can buy most kinds of press.
I hope some of that press makes its way to this reader because she is not a fan of Cabracadabra.
 She hates it.
 I don't hate Cabracadabra.
I just think it objectifies women and contributes to a cheap and damaging culture of sexist commodification that undercuts the exact reason it was started in the first place.
But, you know, everything does that.
Cosmo does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear statues.
Yes, but this objectification of women ended up saving lots of lives, many of whom were also women, so, therefore, not sexist? I can't argue with that.

Spoiler alert from Marley & Me.
That wasn't a spoiler until you said the name of the movie.
If you've got a gig for me, you can go through my new manager.
Oh, I'm not talking about a gig.
Then what are you talking about? Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina! How would you like to be the governor? Whoa.
 Of California?  Yes, of California.
[Diane] Who's at the door? Is it pizza?  [phone ringing, faintly]  [sighs] Welcome back.
Your first meeting's at 10:00, and you have a lunch at 11:30.
 Thank you, Judah.
 Also, I have someone on line two trying to get in touch with BoJack Horseman.
I have no idea how she got this number.
It sounds like it's a teenage girl.
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.
Mmhmm.
I'm sorry.
We can't help you.

 What? No more petitions or fancy ballot initiatives, just a mano a mano, noholdsbarred slippery slalom down an icecovered peak.
Winner gets to be governor, loser goes home.
Your move, Governor.
Mic drop!  [FEEDBACK SQUEAL]  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  Aaah!  [CHEERING] [WOODCHUCK] What the hell is he talking about? It sounds like he's challenging you to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
What an absurd conceit.
Do I even need to respond to this? No, sir.
Because I'd rather focus on my drought relief optimization using geohydration technology, or DROUGHT plan.
If I know anything, this story will go away in a couple of days.
Now Mr.
Peanutbutter, you challenged Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.
Not just any ski race, a highstakes dash down Devil's Mountain  for the governorship itself.
 But still no comment from the governor.
Why won't he race you? That's what I want to know.
You and me both, friendo.
But this isn't an usocracy, it's a democracy.
 [AUDIENCE] Ooh!  So let's ask dem"" what ""dey"" think.",Humor
"[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  Any questions for the governor, folks? [AUDIENCE CHANTS] Why won't Woodchuck race? So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan is actually a drought relief plan.",Humor
I see now how that's confusing.,Humor
Any other questions? Are you going to race Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter? Any questions about the DROUGHT plan? To ski or not to ski? That was the question posed by William Shakespeare and it's perhaps even more relevant today.,Humor
"Of course, there are reasons why a gubernatorial election should not be decided by a ski race, but are there also reasons why it should? For the sake of ""fairness"" we've brought in two experts with opposite opinions who will now have equal time to just say those opinions because that's what news is.",Humor
"You think they'll really race down Devil's Mountain? What do I care? As long as I've got my giant bag of kettle corn, that's the only thing that concerns me.",Humor
[TODD GRUNTS]  [GASPS]  What the?  Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha! Get back here with my kettle corn! You can't call it a drone if you're riding on it.,Humor
"Suckers! Hooray! Ha ha! Oh oh, no! Aw, man.",Humor
"I was hoisted by my own petard, the one petard I thought would never hoist me.",Humor
[WOODCHUCK] Unprecedented poppycock.,Humor
This poppycock has no precedent.,Humor
Maybe it's time to make a statement.,Humor
"Madeline, no.",Humor
This outlandish buffoonery is beneath the office of the governor.,Humor

"Can't you see this thing is eating you alive? Do it for us, Woodcharles.",Humor
Do it for us.,Humor
"[GROANS] And so this ski race would be both undemocratic and unconstitutional, which is why I will not be racing Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.,Humor
What if the state constitution were changed to allow it?  Then would you race Mr.,Humor
Peanutbutter?  I [SIGHS] Fine.,Humor
"If a state senator wanted to waste everybody's time by sponsoring an amendment to the constitution, and the motion got twothirds majority in both houses so as to allow a democraticallyelected governor to accept a ski race challenge for his office, then yes, I would race Mr.",Humor
Peanutbutter.,Humor
"Well, I guess that puts that idea to bed, right?  Hmm.",Humor
Right?  Hmm [CHUCKLES]  Right?! You want me to sponsor a ski race amendment to the constitution? Or you could sponsor the amendment that has a hidden rider doubling farm subsidies in your district.,Humor

Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, I will see you on Devil's Mountain.",Humor
Whoa!  This is insane.,Humor
You could actually become governor by winning a race.,Humor
Yeah.,Humor
Wow.,Humor
"You know, it's days like this I wish I knew how to ski.",Humor
"You don't ski?  Never really got into it, no.",Humor
Then why did you challenge the governor to a ski race? [CHUCKLES] I didn't think it would get this far.,Humor
"You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.",Humor
"Well, I guess that's it.",Humor
"Oh, well.",Humor

"Anyway, things are even crazier around here lately.",Humor
"Don't know if you've seen the news, but I really wish you were here for this.",Humor
"Well, I'm off to ski school so I can learn how to ski, so I can become the governor.",Humor
"[DIANE] You'd say something like, ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.",Humor
" Sounds great, sweetheart.
But as the old saying goes, that's politics.
[DIANE] Then you'd probably say, A, that's not an old saying and, B, that's not politics! Nothing about that is politics.",Humor
" This is so great! Then you would be so overwhelmed by the unbearable ludicrousness of the situation that you would get in your car and drive to Hawaii, which is also a thing you could do now because of a new bill that cost our state billions of dollars.
It's all so great! [SIGHS] You know, it's funny, because the last time I saw you you told me that you needed me in your life, and then you just disappeared.
So how do you think that makes me feel? Well, wherever you are, I hope you're happy.
I really do, BoJack.
Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.
He's not with you, is he? [MUNCHING] Oh, simple kettle corn.

Professor Thistlethorpe, the famously humorless yet somehow also lovable ski instructor? Peanutbutter, is it? Everything about you disgusts me.
Uh And yet, there might be something in you after all.
You really mean it? This shall be my greatest challenge.
Meet me on the summit tomorrow at daybreak.
Well, it is daybreak and here we are at the summit.
First lesson, break your skis in half.
Oh, I don't have skis.
Was I supposed to bring skis?  You didn't say that.
 No bother.
They shan't be required.
Instead, read this book of poetry.
I'll see you in the classroom.
Ah, there you are.
Did you read the book of poetry? No! I forgot to.
 Excellent.
 I'm sor Excellent? My assignment was a test.
Skiing isn't about reading old books.
 It's about speaking truth to power  Oh! and you have spoken it eloquently.
You are my finest student.
I love you.
[COUGHING]  Are you okay, professor?  Just a cough.
I'm sure it's nothing.
You can come by tomorrow for your diploma.
I can't believe ski school is already over.
Professor Thistlethorpe? Professor Thistlethorpe! [WEAKLY] Remember everything I taught you.
I will.
Also, if you have any tips for skiing, that would be really helpful.
The most important part of skiing is to keep your legs ben [SOBBING] Who's Ben? Devil's Mountain is the place, skiing is the sport.
I'm uncomfortable.
It's cold out.
Tell me, who do you think will win today's bout and what does it mean for the future of California? I hate winter sports.
I want to go inside and drink a cider.
 [STARTER'S PISTOL FIRING]  And they're off! [GRUNTS, YELLING] [TOM] Woodchuck, off to a great start.
Mr.
Peanutbutter seems to be employing some sort of awkwardly falling down technique.
 Any sign of them?  Nothing yet.
 Oh! I made you a card.
 You did? [CHUCKLES] Oh, wow, it's sparkly.
Sorry, I went a little overboard with the glitter and a little underboard with the glue.
[RALPH] Let's move in together.",Humor
I think I'm ready now.,Humor
" This is great.
Are you sure, though, because last time you seemed a little hesitant.
 No, I was just a little pregnant.
 Oh! I was gonna tell you, really, but then before I could tell you there was nothing to tell you.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I still wish you would've told me.
I have a card for that.
On the front it says, Life isn't fairage.",Humor
" I'm sorry.
I just felt dumb because all my life I've wanted a family.
But I didn't want it to happen just because I got pregnant by accident  and then you got stuck with me.
 Okay, first of all, if I get stuck to something, you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.
 You know what I mean.
 Second, if that's how you feel, maybe you shouldn't get pregnant by accident.
 Well, I didn't try to!  No.
I'm saying maybe we should get you pregnant on purpose.
 Really?  Yeah.
We love each other, and we enjoy having sex with each other and we're good at having sex with each other.
And also, I think you'd be an amazing mother.
 [SIGHS]  Even Blake Lively thinks so.
Ah, still got it.
Yes! [GRUNTING, YELLING] Whoa! Whoahoho! Ohh! Get control.
Woodchuck in the lead, still in the lead.
Woodchuck remains very much in the lead.
Goodbye, dear friend.
You served me well.
[GASPS] Okay, all right, here we go.
Mr.
Peanutbutter? Ohh! [YELLING] [GRUNTING, GASPING] [YELLING] [GASPING] [PANTING] I see Woodchuck! Yes! Go, Woodcharles! Oh whoa [GRUNTS] Whoa! Oh, my God.

 [MOANING]  Oh ohh.
 Did I win?  Come on, honey.
Let's go home.
 [APPLAUSE]  Well, I hope that settles it.
We can finally put an end to this nonsense.
Sir, the rules are clear: the first person to cross the finish line becomes governor, and, well, a strange boy fell out of the sky and crossed the line first.
They're swearing him in now.
 So help me Todd.
 Congratulations, Governor Chavez.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] You know, ever since I first became governor I've thought, I don't want to be governor"" and that's where I am now.",Humor
"So, can I not be governor? [GROANING AND GASPING] You'd like to resign? Yeah.",Humor
I'm just really not into labels right now.,Humor
Maybe after some soul searching I'll be ready to really know what I am.,Humor
"But for right now, I think I speak for all Californians when I say, ""I ate too much kettle corn while drifting through the sky on an out of control drone throne.",Humor
" Okay, is this charade over? Can I be governor again? Sir, we live in a society of laws.
When a governor resigns, that triggers a special election.
Until which, the governor's seat shall remain vacant.
 [ALL GASPING]  Election, you say? Mr.
Peanutbutter, will you run?  You bet I will, and you know why?  No, tell me.
Because this whole ski race was a joke.
Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.
He went to Dartmouth.
So where's the candidate for regular schmoes like me,  who went to Northwestern?  Is he serious right now? You know, Governor Woodchuck CoodchuckBerkowitz thinks he's better than us, but is he better than us?  [CROWD] No!  Uh, if I could say a few words He thinks the race is over.
Well, I say it's just starting.
And he wants me to sit and stay and roll over?  No!  I say California's tired of rolling over.
What do you say?  [CROWD] Yeah!  [WOMAN] I'm tired.
I say it's time for me to stand up and speak.

You know Mr.
Taken from the Taken movies?  This is his niece.
 Nice! This was supposed to be Courtney's crossover coronation.
But that's sort of been thwarted, unfortunately, 'cause Courtney's purportedly falling short of shoring up fourquadrant support.
Makes perfect sense so far.
The public sees her as out of touch.
We need to make her seem relatable, and the best way to do that is to be seen dating a downtoearth boring nobody like yourself.

Everyone has very strong opinions about it, and I want you all to know, right here and right now, I am taking a stand.
I am on your side!  What side is that, specifically?  Good question.
I am specifically on the side of the facts, and also on the side of feelings.

Sorry about knocking you out.
Once you have chloroform, you can't not use it.
No, I get it.
BoJack had one of those spy kits, too.
He mostly just used the chloroform on himself, though.
I read in his book that you live together.
 Can you help me find him?  Sorry.
I don't live there anymore.
And no one knows where he's been for the last year.
I guess I don't have to meet him.
All I need is a DNA sample, like a piece of hair or something.
I guess his house might have  Whoa!  Sorry again.
It's just so fun.
Okay, there might be some hairs in the shower drain, but hard to know who they belong to.
Everyone who has sex with BoJack usually takes a long shower afterwards.

Oh, no, BoJack.
 Yoink!  What the was  Okay.
 Okay, let's blow.
Blow? Who's got blow? Save some for BoJack.

Are you gonna yell at me? Can I have the blow first? No.
BoJack, there's no blow, okay? And I'm not going to yell at you.
 And what is this?  I'm Hollyhock ManheimMannheimGuerreroRobinson ZilberschlagHsungFonzerelliMcQuack.
Of the New Haven Manheim MannheimGuerreroRobinson ZilberschlagHsungFonzerelliMcQuacks? That was a joke.
Obviously, I've never heard of your family and/or law firm.
That was also a joke.
Todd, who is this tough crowd you brought to my home?  Um, BoJack, this is your daught  Mmmmm, mmmmm! dotdot maid.
Way to build up the suspense.
To, uh, tidy up the place in case you came back.
You got me a maid? Thank you.
Here I thought Channing Tatum was a good neighbor for picking up my mail while I was gone, but you, and after all the things I did to you,  I don't know how to tell you  BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year, and that's actually been kind of working for me.
So, maybe it's better if we just keep things like that, you know? Oh.
Okay.
So then why did you hire me Oh, yeah, deliver me.
You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.
Can you tell me if this is a match?  A match with who?  Hollyhock.
ManheimMannheimGorillaRubaDubDub ZoolanderHallelujah somethingMcDonald's? Whatever those words are, I need a sample from her, too.
Duh! Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.
Nothing like working with hair, blood, and semen all day to work up an appetite, and it's already 1:00.
1:00? I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend! Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too? Mine is a bunch of water balloons with a blonde wig.
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this is too fancy for a common man such as yourself.
No, it's fine.
You'd probably like to take me someplace rough and primitive.
Uh do you want me to take you somewhere else? Well, if you must drag me on some barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.
There's a Pony Roma's at Universal CityWalk.
A chain restaurant? Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.
I can't do this.
Todd, I can never be your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.
 I must abscond.
 Wait, Courtney! Scusi, sir, would you care for a sample of my father's famous angel hair pomodoro? Famous father? Hair? Sample?  DNA?  I no say DNA.
I gotta get back to Hollyhock.
Hollyhock, I need to get  Did you clean anything?  No.
But I am learning so much about my possiblymaybe birth father.
Like, did you know he has a shoebox in his closet full of bad reviews for other people's TV shows? So all you've done so far is snoop around? I also ate a box of donuts, got sleepy and took a nap.
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need to do this DNA test.
Look, I didn't come all this way to not find out who my biological father is.
Okay, fine, then I just need you to yank out a strand of hair  so I can take it down to the lab.
 No way! That sounds painful.
 Can't we just use your hair?  Um No.
No, but I can pull out some of my hair at the same time,  so you don't have to do it alone.
 Okay, that sounds fair.
On three, we pull.
 One two three!  Ow! Oh, wait, I have this whole comb full of hair in my bag.
Duh! Todd, can I see you for a minute? This maid is the worst.
I passed out again for some reason.
When I woke up, the house was messier than when she started.
I don't mind someone else in the house with me, in case I start choking on pills or have a funny take on current events that demands an audience, but if she can't do her job, I gotta fire her.
You can't do that! Here, buzz up real nice, take a nap, and while you're sleeping, I'll get the maid to clean so no one has to fire anyone.
Well, we did it.
What? I'm helping.
I'm cleaning out his DVR.
Get it? Okay, but you got it, right? ToToToTodd! Todd's phone, home of the Todd.

I tested your DNA against another sample's DNA, and apparently the two are related.
 You're a father.
 Wait, what?  Okay.
Thanks!  Todd.
I was going to write a story and drag your name through the mud just because I thought a couple more people would click on an article I wrote.
But I don't think that's the kind of journalist I want to be.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this line of work.
Sorry to bother you.
Uh Hey, I obviously don't know you because I am Channing Tatum, the guy from Green Lantern or whatever, and you are a nobody, but you came all the way over here to warn me about something you hadn't even written yet.
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum, I'd say you're exactly the kind of journalist we need in this world.
Wow! That doesn't sound at all like Channing Tatum's voice, but that is the kind of thing I would want Channing Tatum to say to me, so thanks, Channing.
Love half your movies! That was a close one, huh, Hollyhock?  Hollyhock?  ToToToTodd! Todd's phone.
What do you want? So, I see lots of pictures of you at the fashion show,  but none of you with Courtney.
 Oh, crap!  Hi.
 Oh, hello.
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes? These aren't anything like your clothes.
This hat alone cost $50,000.
Oh.
So, uh What's it like being a movie star? It's awfully trying.
Do you ever feel like everyone's looking at you  but nobody sees you?  Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.
No, I was speaking rhetorically about a feeling that only movie stars get.
Ohh.
 Okay.
 But it feels good to talk about it.
Yeah.
Talking's good.
You know, there was a meeting I was supposed to go to tonight, but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.
 Ready for what?  What if it's not everything I want it to be? Sometimes the idea of something is better than the truth, you know? I always prefer fiction to truth, personally.
I've staked my career on it.
Yeah, that makes sense.
 Ha hah!  Smile for the birdie.
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling with a supermodel now?  That's right.
 Fancy.
I love how not downtoearth you are together.
This is going to really make headlines when you two break up.
Here's an even bigger headline: we shan't be breaking up.
 We're engaged!  Wowee! Hooray! I'm confused! Hollyhock? Are you here? No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um  Hollyhock is your daughter.
 What do you mean?  She's your daughter.
 I don't understand.
 She has Horseman DNA.
 What is that mean?  You're her father.
 That's impossible.
I'm BoJack.
She didn't want me to tell you, but I thought you should know.
I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.
BoJack Look what I do to people I'm supposed to care about.
I had sex with the one person I've ever seen you be in love with.
I guess they're not gonna put you in the best friends hall of fame, but I don't know that I loved her.
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.
Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.
All you ever asked for was a roof over your head and the occasional s'more in a baguette.
I'm telling you, it's a milliondollar idea.
I got more of you than I ever deserved.
If you never talk to me again I just want you to know that I appreciate it, and I appreciate you.
Thanks.
It was shitty what you did with Emily, but, um I think I'm Asexual.

I am sick and tired of reallife gun violence getting in the way of us telling stories that glamorize gun violence.
Why does this keep happening? Has the whole world gone crazy?

Why not make yourself useful and schedule a sitdown with Courtney Portnoy's team to talk about how we distance ourselves from this fakakte mishegoss.

I'll do everything I can to help find your mom.
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.
In fact, in my experience, they're soulless succubi born fully formed from the ass of Satan.
Oh, my grandmother sounds like quite a character.
 Can I meet her?  Oh, my mom? No, you cannot meet my mom because she's dead.
 Oh.
 Dead mom.
BoJack, what happened to the fudgesicles I bought?  I lied again.
My mom's not dead.
 Stop lying to me! That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.
Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.
I do.
Where does she live? Oh, this spectacular elder care facility, she has her own private room with a nice view, 'roundtheclock medical care, and plenty of other seniors to say casually cruel things to under a passiveaggressive veil of plausible deniability.
What's this place called? I want to say Whispering Pines.

 Where have you been?  Listen.
I'm sorry.
I was an awful boyfriend to you.
I was an awful client, and I was an awful friend.

And you might be the most special of them all.
Wow, BoJack.
[CHUCKLES] I I appreciate that.
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is, do you remember the name of that super nice elder care facility that we both agreed was the best place for my mom to run out the clock? Oh, pluck a duck.
It's called Walnut Springs.
Walnut Springs! I knew there was a W in there.
Bye!  [SIGHS]  [RINGING] What? I feel like I didn't strike the right tone in the last phone call.
I really am sorry, and the most important thing is, you know how dedicated I am to making things right again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is, turns out there's a few Walnut Springses in the SoCal area.
It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy!  Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died?  A lotta people!  [PANTING]  Sorry, what did I miss? Courtney's beloved was outlining his plan to curtail gun violence.
I'm just saying, if people have the right pumpedup kicks, maybe they can outrun the bullets.
All this talk of gun violence is depressing.
Ms.
Taken is a movie about empowerment.
That's what I've been saying! It's Bridget Jones with slightly more bloody murdering.
We just have to keep the story on Courtney, and not on the depressingly unstoppable rise of reallife gun violence in this country, thoughts and prayers.

"Guess your daughter, the bikini model, will have to pick you up at the park.",Humor
"Daughter, the bikini model? Whoa, whoa, Ethan, this man is our guest! [LAUGHS] Uh Huh.",Humor
"[CLEARS THROAT]  You know I hate guns, right?  I know.",Humor
Although my official stated political opinion is I respect the Second Amendment but I think some gun purchases should require the barest amount of background checks.,Humor
Mr.,Humor
"Peanutbutter, you know I hate guns, too.",Humor
Or I thought I did.,Humor
"Or I still do, mostly.",Humor
But being a gun owner finally makes me feel as safe walking down the street as a man gets to feel all the time.,Humor
And that's an incredible feeling I'm not ready to give up yet.,Humor
"If you can frack under our house, I should get to have a gun.",Humor
"All right, that's fair.",Humor
I'm really proud we've found a way to keep our personal lives and our political lives compartmentalized.,Humor
"Me, too.",Humor
You have no idea  Yes.,Humor
"I have no idea?  Is your bubble of privilege so thick,  What's with humans and guns? You're addicted to these things.",Humor
And what is it with men and not wanting women to feel safe?  I don't  This is a gendered issue  Excuse me!  make no mistake.,Humor
I don't think women  You can't sympathize running around with guns makes anybody safer.,Humor
Yeah.,Humor
That's the danger.,Humor
I don't  Excuse me.,Humor
"Not the men who commit 90 percent of murders, it's the crazy hysterical women you gotta worry about! [GRUNTING AND MOANING] [DIANE] Yes, yes! Fill my chamber with your powerful bullets! Beatrice, look who's back.",Humor
And we brought more Horsin' Around.,Humor
Oh? Good.,Humor
"Because you love that BoJack, right? Well, he's not much of a son, but the show can be a comfort sometimes.",Humor
[EXHALES] They were playing your dumb show in his hospital room.,Humor
"Which dumb show? New one or old one? In the episode I saw, you walked in on your daughter in the shower.",Humor
The old one.,Humor
"That episode got us into the TV Guide ""Cheers and Jeers"" column.",Humor
"We did not get a ""Cheers.",Humor
" You always could play the fool, BoJack.
We have to have this conversation now, on the way to Dad's funeral? [SIGHS] There was so much more I wanted to say to him.
Well you can forget it now.
[LAUGHS] [OLIVIA] And since you saw me naked, that means I get to see you naked! [THE HORSE] Something tells me I'm gonna regret this.
 [AUDIENCE LAUGHING]  [GROANS] Out of the way, hag, you're blocking the screen.
Uhhuh.
I know this must be painful for you.
Not painful, boring.
This place sucks.
If I'm not getting credit for coming, what's the point? If only there was some way for her to connect the BoJack from the show with the BoJack who visits her every week.
 Yeah, too bad we can't.
Or can we?  Can we what? Put on a live episode of Horsin' Around in the nursing home.
 Good thinking, Hollyhock.
 Uh We'll do a Horsin' Around here at the home.
She'll love it because it's her son BoJack.
 Okay  Then after the show, I'll come out and say hello.
And she'll say, BoJack? Is that you?"" When her eyes spark with recognition, I'm gonna sit down next to her, I'm gonna squeeze her hand and get real close and say  ""Fuck you, Mom.",Humor
"  What? I can finally tell her off! I'm gonna say, Look at you"", you old piece of shit, rotting in a nursing home!""  Now I have the power!  That's what you want to say to her? Oh, it's gonna be great! I can't wait to see the look on her face.",Humor
"Okay, let's do this.",Humor
Let's put on a show! [RINGING]  Hey!  Bad news.,Humor
Hear about the mass shooting outside Tulsa? Terrible tragedy.,Humor
Thoughts and prayers.,Humor
"We really have to do something about these men who go No, P.",Humor
C.,Humor
This time it was a woman.,Humor
"A woman mass shooter? Oh, no, that really is bad news! I just think this is what happens when you give women guns.",Humor
They start shooting people with them.,Humor
"I mean, do they even know what guns are for? I don't feel safe anymore walking down my own street alone at night.",Humor
"Me, a man! I am convening a series of congressional hearings on the matter of women and guns.",Humor
Because even one death from the bullet of a female gun owner is too many.,Humor
"What are my constituents supposed to do, not compliment random women on the street because they might be carrying a gun? We cannot allow our lives to be dictated by that kind of fear.",Humor
"So you see, the trigger was specifically designed for a man's grip and a man's temperament.",Humor
"Look, all I'm saying is maybe you shouldn't blame women for wanting guns.",Humor
Maybe you should blame the constant societal messaging that tells us we are safe only as long as the men around us allow us to be.,Humor
"So if you have a problem with women carrying firearms, you can roll up your sleeves and actually work to create a society where women feel safe and equal, or you can just ban all guns.",Humor
[GAVEL BANGING]  The ayes have it.,Humor
Possession of any firearm is now illegal in the state of California.,Humor
"We did it, boys.",Humor
Huzzah!  Yes!  Congratulations!  Fabulous! I thought that was gonna go the other way.,Humor
"Wow, Diane.",Humor
You just passed sensible gun legislation.,Humor
I can't believe this country hates women more than it loves guns.,Humor
"No? BoJack, I don't know about this.",Humor
You'll be fine.,Humor
Just remember to enunciate.,Humor
It helps if you imagine performing for the back row.,Humor
Not that.,Humor
I mean  Shh! Here they come.,Humor
"Gladys, hit it! [PLAYS HORSIN' AROUND THEME] Too bad I could never run for president, 'cause I love waffling! Wha What is this? Olivia, you usually love my breakfast humor.",Humor

"Xaxis? Yaxis?  [PANTING AND GASPING] Where's the 'Y'shouldIcare axis? Henrietta, what are you doing? BoJack, maybe we should stop.",Humor
We just started.,Humor
"Let's at least get through the first act before we judge ourselves too harshly, huh? I wonder if there's a way to make math fun.",Humor
[HOLLYHOCK] Math will never be fun.,Humor
"[CLICKING] The only thing I like,  is rap music songs.",Humor
[GROANING AND PANTING] Make this stop.,Humor
How do I turn this off? Don't change it.,Humor
I want to see if this married couple can work through their differences.,Humor

"Oh, God.",Humor
I am the heiress to the Sugarman Sugarcube Company.,Humor
You can't do this to me! [SCREAMING] I never get to watch what I want.,Humor
"You think we should still finish the episode, or? Our insurance policy is very strict and very clear.",Humor
"Once a resident becomes violent, we can no longer house them.",Humor
"Can you recommend another facility? Frankly, at your mother's rate of deterioration, she probably doesn't have much time.",Humor
I recommend she spend it surrounded by the people who care about her.,Humor
"Okay, who are they? Do you have their number? I was referring to you and your daughter.",Humor
Oh.,Humor
Uh  We'll take her.,Humor
"She can have the guest room,  and I can sleep on the couch.",Humor
Right?  [GROANS] Okay.,Humor
If she really doesn't have much time left.,Humor
"But if we get to this time next year, she's still hanging on, you will be getting a very strongly worded letter, mister.",Humor
"Excuse me, could you point me in the direction of an H&M?  Sure.",Humor
"[CLICK] That's all we got, once we took out all the guns.",Humor
Maybe it could work as an H&M commercial? It's a shame.,Humor
It was a great movie.,Humor
[SIGHS] Yeah.,Humor
Cut down in the prime of its life.,Humor
"Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.",Humor
"Eh, I'll be fine.",Humor
"Hey, Beatrice, you hungry? I could make PopTarts.",Humor
"[BEA] No, thank you.",Humor
You want to watch another Horsin' Around episode? What's the point?  Oh.,Humor
"[GROWLS] Oh, God.",Humor
I'm sorry you didn't get to tell your mom off.,Humor
I keep thinking about all the things I never said because I was so sure there'd be other days to say them.,Humor
Why don't you tell her now?  It's not the same.,Humor
"I should have done it back when she knew who I was, back when it would mean something.",Humor
"But now, she's gonna die and she's never gonna know just how much I hate her.",Humor
"I'm sure she knew, BoJack.",Humor
"Yeah? You're not just saying that?  She read your book, didn't she? [SIGHS] Yeah, but I really wanted to say it to her face.",Humor
"Well, hey, she's here now, right? And she has good days and bad days.",Humor
"Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.",Humor
And then you can totally rip into her.,Humor
You really think so?  Mmhmm.,Humor

Taken was a miserable failure.,Humor

"Yes, the film is spectacularly romantic and welltitled, but I need a change in representation.",Humor
No! Courtney! Before you fire me I'm not gonna fire you.,Humor
"Heavens, no! I fired my agents.",Humor
"Oh, good.",Humor
"Yeah, agents are replaceable.",Humor
A manager is forever.,Humor
That's the takeaway here.,Humor
I think you'll fall in love with my new agent.,Humor
Love her already.,Humor
Who is she?  He.,Humor
"Yes, he, he, ha, ha.",Humor
Now tell me her name.,Humor
Rutabaga Rabitowitz.,Humor
"Oh, fish.",Humor
We got a nice bounce off of Court's engagement.,Humor
"Court is what I'm calling Courtney for wordplayrelated reasons that'll become apparent at the end of this sentence, but that bounce has lost its pounce, and if we want to keep this name in the news, we're going to need a fullcourt press.",Humor
So what do you do after an engagement? Ddddoy! Wedding of the century.,Humor
Whoa! We're talking floral arrangements.,Humor
We're talking procession of elephants.,Humor
"We're talking Jaden Smith in a Clockwork Orange costume, reading a poem he wrote Does that poem rhyme? No! What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.",Humor
"And, uhoh, was someone looking for Sebastian Janikowski, because here's the kicker We do the whole thing the weekend before the movie drops.",Humor
Bam!  Weekend before the movie drops?  Boom!  That's this weekend.,Humor
Kazow!  Four days from today.,Humor
Ooh.,Humor
Today? That's today! Which is why it's so perfect.,Humor
No notice is the new notice.,Humor
This wedding is so fancy we don't care if you have other plans.,Humor
Total status move.,Humor
You're right.,Humor
"Being engaged is one thing, but I'm not sure I want to actually get married.",Humor
"We can draw up a standard Hollywoo shammarriage contract: Three years, nonexclusive,  huge payday.",Humor
Oh.,Humor
And I presume you'll be arranging everything.,Humor
"As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help, but I believe traditionally it's the bride's manager who plans the wedding.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
Idiot.,Humor
Stupid animal.,Humor
Oaf.,Humor
You are just the prettiest thing.,Humor
"Yes, you are.",Humor
"Who are you talking to? Keep it down, oaf.",Humor

"Baby?  Yes, you are.",Humor
"She kept asking where the baby was, so I had Tina get her this doll.",Humor
She's totes into it.,Humor
"Mom is ""totes"" into a baby? Is it possible the baby got dipped in brandy at some point? Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas about immigrants?  I think she just wanted a baby.",Humor
Coochiecoochiecoo You shouldn't indulge her delusions.,Humor
It's not right.,Humor
But she seemed really down.,Humor
And you're never around anymore.,Humor
It was getting depressing to look at her.,Humor
That's why I made her this pillowcase.,Humor
You just put this over her head and everything is fine.,Humor

Good for you.,Humor
That's amazing.,Humor
"I know it's pretty wild for an asexual to get married, but Not really.",Humor
John and I are aces and we're married.,Humor
Really?  Yeah.,Humor
Our wedding was nauticalthemed.,Humor
"Why nautical? Is that, like, an asexual thing? No, man.",Humor
We just really like boats.,Humor
Asexual just means you're not interested in sex.,Humor
"Some asexuals are also aromantic, but others have relationships like anyone else.",Humor
But involving boats? I feel like you're getting really hung up on the boats thing.,Humor
"So, it's not weird for an ace to get married? No, if you found someone who really accepts you for who you are, go for it.",Humor
"I will! I mean, I am.",Humor
"I mean, am I? Mmm! Beatrice, this coffee is amazing.",Humor
You stupid garbage fire.,Humor
Everything sucks.,Humor
"BoJack, did you see what your mother is doing? Isn't it incredible? Yeah, making breakfast at three in the afternoon.",Humor
So with it.,Humor
Isn't this baby wellbehaved? Hardly ever cries.,Humor
"Probably because you're such a good mother, Beatrice.",Humor
Don't say that.,Humor
"I was very nervous to have a baby in the house, but it turns out, all it needed is a mother's love.",Humor
"Oh, when you grow up, you can be anything you want to be.",Humor
Lousy baby.,Humor
"What did it ever do that was so great? Am I jealous of a doll? Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug, looking at me with its creepy doll eyes She's tricking you, Hollyhock.",Humor
This is not what she's really like.,Humor
"Who cares? Whatever beef you have with your mom, that's just a sweet confused old lady.",Humor
She's right.,Humor
Wrong.,Humor
She's in there.,Humor
She knows exactly what she's doing.,Humor
You are so paranoid.,Humor
Please stop fighting.,Humor
All this shouting is bad for the baby.,Humor
"Where was that keen parenting insight 50 years ago? Henrietta, you're unfit to be a parent.",Humor
"I'm unfit?  It's true, jackass.",Humor
You think it's so hard to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.,Humor
"Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.",Humor
"Hope I don't drop it! Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.",Humor
Guess it's okay.,Humor
I'm an amazing parent.,Humor
"What if I left it in its room all day and didn't feed it or change it? Oh, that's okay, too.",Humor
I must be mother of the year!  BoJack.,Humor
"I know! What if for 18 years straight I just tell it how worthless it is every day, how it embarrasses me, how my life would be better if it was never born? Would that be a good idea? Probably, right? Give me the baby back, you worthless waste of my husband's jism!  Oh, so you do know who I am.",Humor
"Govern yourself, Henrietta.",Humor
"Hey, you think the baby would be okay if I threw it over the side of my deck? Probably, right? BoJack, don't.",Humor
Do it.,Humor
"Nah, I'm just kidding around.",Humor
"Here you go, Mom.",Humor
"Oh, no! My hands are so slippery! Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh! No! Nice arm.",Humor
Why did you do that? You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.,Humor
This is what you do.,Humor
This is what you always do.,Humor
This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.,Humor
She's right.,Humor
Doll never hurt anybody.,Humor
Doll wouldn't throw you over the side of a mountain.,Humor
Gotta make things right.,Humor
Gotta get Doll back.,Humor
"Okay, one drink.",Humor
"And then, Doll back.",Humor
You screwup.,Humor
You're making your daughter hate you.,Humor
"Which is good, because look what happens when people love you.",Humor
Look at Penny.,Humor
And Herb.,Humor
And Sarah Lynn.,Humor
"It's because you made them love you, BoJack.",Humor
"You gotta fix this, dummy.",Humor
How can you fix this? Princess Carolyn? She hates your guts.,Humor

"Diane! What are you doing? No, not like this.",Humor
She doesn't know I'm here.,Humor
First time she sees me can't be drunk asking for help.,Humor
What's wrong? You need help?  Idiot.,Humor
You gotta get me outta here.,Humor
Where did I park?  Um  Beep.,Humor
"Beep, beep? You shouldn't be driving right now.",Humor
"Why don't I make like Eddie Money and take you home tonight? No, I can't go home.",Humor
Not without Doll.,Humor
"Also, Eddie Money doesn't do the taking home in ""Take Me Home Tonight,"" so if you're taking me home, then I would be Eddie Money.",Humor
"Okay, something's going on with you.",Humor
It's not like you to be so testy.,Humor
"Yes, it is.",Humor
"Everyone, take the rest of the day off.",Humor
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.,Humor
"California can wait! Elton, you have to play this wedding.",Humor
We want one of those Stranger Things kids to be the ringbearer.,Humor
They're still little? You're gonna do a duet with a hologram of Nat King Cole.,Humor
"Or, if that's costprohibitive, Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes.",Humor
Puberty? Can we give them something for that?  Great.,Humor
Fabulous.,Humor
We are killing this.,Humor
We are doing to this wedding what Rob Durst did to that lady and what Fred Durst did to his career.,Humor
I have terrible news.,Humor
It's Meryl Streep.,Humor
"Did Meryl Streep die? No, she's retiring.",Humor
Mr.,Humor
"McGregor! You cannot just walk into a room and say, ""I have terrible news about Meryl Streep.",Humor
" Her retirement party is scheduled for this Saturday.
All of Hollywoo will be attending.
This Saturday? No, no, no! How is #TortneyChortnoy supposed to compete with that? We're toast.
Unless, uh, we could somehow get Meryl to postpone her party? Hmm what if we put together a project so enticing she couldn't help but climb aboard?  One more gig  Means no more retirement.
But what could we possibly offer her that she hasn't already done?  Ah.
What does every actor want to do?  Direct.
 Direct!  Yeah.
But the dream of any director is to work with Meryl Streep.
You think Meryl wants to direct a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?  Hah! What a nightmare!  Okay, all right.
Okay, fine.
But, okay, okay, and this What if all the actors in the movie were Meryl Streep?  What? No!  Are you suggesting some sort of.
The Klumps type situation where Meryl Streep plays every role? Bingobongo, weirdobeardo.
All the greats have done it.
Peter Sellers, Sir Alec Guinness, Flo from the Progressive ads.
Let's take this to the Streep.
Hey, look.
Maybe this is a baby? Mmm.
 Welcome  Hey, hey! to the nightmare, nonsexy version of Three's Company that my life has become.
Oh, good.
Instead of getting the doll back, like you said you would, you disappeared for a few hours and found a friend.
For your information, we are on the case.
Just need a whiff of your mom to track the scent.
Uh, excuse me, young lady, I'm looking for a Beatrice, but you're way too young and attractive to be that mean old crone.
 What?  What are you doing? Okay, I'm picking up on some fruity overtones.
Oak, desert sage No, I'm just kidding around.
It's smelling humor.
Is this the best time to be workshopping your tight five? Okay, got it.
Ooh, this way? No! No, no.
That way! Out the door! Come on! Here we go! Look at him.
Not a care in the world.
How does he do it? This is the place.
 Oh, hi, I'm  BoJack Horseman.
 Felicity Huffman?  Looking for this?  Yes!  Well, keep looking, buddy! You're a real piece of shit, you know that? Yes.
So, instead of talking through your issues, your new thing is to just get in really big fights and then have hot angry sex?  Yeah, but it kind of works.
 Does it? I'm sorry, I feel like we always talk about me.
What's going on with you, Roxie?  I'm actually glad you asked, I  Okay.
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice on something? Yeah, of course.
I'm not doing anything.
 Um  So, I have this friend, and his name is Darnarius McQuimberton.
Oh, yeah, I think I read an article about him in Real, Not MadeUp, Person Magazine.
Darnarius is supposed to get married this weekend.
And it's going to be an amazing wedding, but it's kind of based on a lie.
Should he go through with it? Well, all weddings are lies, right? Sort of.
You're making this big declaration about how you're gonna stay with this person forever, but you don't actually know that.
You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.
 Yeah, that's true.
 But it's a lie based on truth.
Like, at the center of the farce there's this nugget of something real and pure.
And that strange beautiful something is why you put up with everything else, right? I guess so.
And sometimes it's hard to remember that pure, shining thing because it's been painted over with so many arguments and compromises and disappointments.
But you have to believe it's still down there somewhere, even if you can't see it.
And maybe even the belief in it is more important than the thing itself, but only as long as you still believe it.
 Does that make sense?  Yeah.
Thanks, Diane.
You've given me and Darquimbertus McNarington a lot to think about.
That was good advice.
I'm, like, a really good friend.
 What?  Okay.
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.
She's very sick, very frail.
And I know you're really mad at me because Think, shitforbrains, think.
Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you? You cut her off in traffic, got her fired off a project, talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit and didn't realize your mic was on.
I have been living directly under your house for the last 15 years.
Do you have any idea how much shit you throw over the side of your deck? Beer bottles, lit cigarettes, scripts where the lead is female.
One time, a mountain of regurgitated cotton candy sat on that hill for a month before sliding into my hot tub.
Who you think has to deal with that? I assume your maid or gardener or something? Well, yeah.
But it's still superobnoxious.
You're not getting that doll back.
Citizens, citizens.
As the future governor of California, I pride myself on probably being able to reach compromises across the ideological spectrum.
 Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?  What?  Why would we do that?  No.
So you both agree that's a bad idea.
Perhaps you're not so different after all?  Peanutbutter.
 How is that? Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star of film and television.
BoJack, you have also appeared in film and television.
What's that like? Discuss.
I'm sorry for my acquaintance.
I'm actually a big fan.
I hope she has no followup questions.
Really? So you've probably seen my new show,  F.
H.
B.
A.
Los Angeles.
 What? Yup, love it.
How'd you like to do an arc for sweeps? Ugh, TV? No.
I just got out of that sinkhole.
He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.
Hup ho hup! What's your status? I have breached Compound Streep.
If I don't make it out of this alive, just know I have already seen heaven and it is Meryl's rose garden.
 And the offer?  I put it under a big box that's propped up by a stick.
If she goes to look and the box falls on her, she's contractually obligated to do the movie.
Yeah, I know what packaging talent"" means.",Humor
"Okay, she's walking up to the box.",Humor
"She's sniffing around, and We got Meryl! All right! Yes! What if I throw myself off my deck into Felicity Huffman's backyard.",Humor
"If she found my dead body, that'd show her.",Humor
Why are we at a bar? We're just celebrating getting Doll back.,Humor
You don't want to bring the doll back to your mom? I will.,Humor
We're just having a drink first.,Humor
Relax.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
He knows you're terrible.,Humor
"He's the biggest idiot in the world, even he knows you're terrible.",Humor
"So when did you get a daughter? She's new, right?  Or was she always part of the gang?  I met her about a month ago.",Humor
Whoa!  Yeah.,Humor
"And it was great, at first.",Humor
"But now I can feel her getting attached, and I just know I'm gonna BoJack things up.",Humor
"BoJack things up? You mean, show up somewhere and be the life of the party? Then share a laugh with your good friend, Mr.",Humor
"Peanutbutter? No, obviously I meant screw everything up until she hates me.",Humor
I don't think I can take that.,Humor
"Maybe this time, don't do the thing that makes her hate you.",Humor
"I don't want to, but every time she looks at me with those big innocent eyes, all I can think about is every shitty thing I've ever done, and I think, ""I don't deserve that kind of love.",Humor
" Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot about balancing a state budget  or how a bill becomes a law.
 Uh I don't know a lot about a lot of things.
Everybody deserves to be loved.
So we put together an allstar wedding and a Meryl Streep movie in one day!  You got to admit, we're a good team.
 Rutabaga I know it wasn't always smooth sailing for the Good Ship You and Me, but now you've got a boyfriend and I've got a family, and since we have to work together again, we're a good team.
Tell me you didn't miss this.
 Todd is on line two.
 Aaah! Do you go through the walls? Todd! Have you finished your groomsmen list? We gotta figure out how many parachutes we need.
Uh, guys, I I can't marry Courtney.
 What?  No! I've been doing some thinking, and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.
The lollipop part is a lie, but at the center of the lie there's a truth.
That's the Tootsie Roll, and that's why people get married.
But if I married Courtney it would be a lie without any truth in it, like a Tootsie Pop with just the lollipop part and nothing in the middle.
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.
I guess it's a bad analogy.
But I don't want a fake marriage.
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.
Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.
Thanks, Princess Carolyn.
Whoa All right, blue sky time.
Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow? Courtney got jilted, play the sympathy card? I guess we could put out a statement.
That's your solution? What happened to the guy from this morning with all the big ideas? Oh, that guy dies at six.
This guy's gotta get home.
I got seven kids and a wife who's really into me coparenting, or, as she calls it, parenting.",Humor
" Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed, read them some script coverage of the film adaptation of Good Night Moon and then come back?  This is important.
 Well, my kids are important.
Fine, both things are equally important.
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.
You would be hilarious at it.
Hey, today was fun.
I'll call you in the morning.
We'll figure this out.
We'll deal with it.
If you'd like to never see him again, I have ways of getting rid of him.
What kind of ways? Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.
I apologize for misleading you about the number of ways.
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me? I worked with guys like him at F.
M.
E.
When I left, I swore I would never work at a big agency again, because I can't work with people like that.
You don't think I'm like that? No, because you care about people other than yourself.
And for what it's worth, you will be a wonderful mother.
 You're not just saying that?  I never just say anything.
I choose words very carefully, with an eye towards precision and expediency.
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.
 Good night, Judah.
 Mmhmm.
Okay.
 It's about time, Henrietta.
 You're welcome.
Go talk to her, idiot.
Drink first.
No, you stupid alcoholic.
Talk to your daughter.
You're ruining her.
You know that, right? No matter what, your poison is already in her.
There's nothing you can do.
That's not true.
Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.
You're a real stupid piece of shit, and everywhere you go you destroy people.
Your mother never loved you.
That's why Sarah Lynn died, Charlotte'll never forgive you.
What you gonna do to Hollyhock? What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up! Got Doll back.
No big deal.
Where do you go, when you disappear all day? Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.
Sometimes I pull over by the side of the road, just sit there for hours.
Why? And you'd rather do that  than spend time with me?  Hollyhock I know you didn't ask for this dorky 17yearold to just show up at your door.
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying, but I didn't ask  No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
 Oh.
If I'm shitty, that's just because I'm shitty.
You're allowed to be mad at me, but you need to know that whatever I do, it's not your fault.
I know.
I mean, I know, but I don't always know, you know? Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes, like, Hey, everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!"" I know what you mean.",Humor
"That voice, the one that tells you you're worthless and stupid and ugly?  Yeah?  It goes away, right? It's just, like, a dumb teenagegirl thing, but then it goes away? Yeah.",Humor

What's going on down here? Anyone's looking for us? We're cool.
Just being cool, don't worry.
Diane, have you just been getting drunk with BoJack this whole time?  What? I'm still mad at you.
 [BOJACK LAUGHING]  Citizens, remain calm.
 Yeah, that's what I've been saying! Rescue workers are coming but it could be a while.
State emergency funds have been depleted due to budget overruns on a costly bridge to Hawaii that's being constructed.
Oh, yeah! Since a woodchuck is a digging animal, I came to get you out early.
Is that what a woodchuck is? Why did I think it was like a beaver? What's it like out there, Woodchuck? Whole neighborhood totaled?  Is the city in chaos?  No, it's really just your house.
Because of all the fracking that's been happening underneath your house.
Oh! Interesting!  Ayyiyi.
 Oh, right, right.
So you just burrowed down here to rescue your political opponent's top donors.
That's convenient.
It was actually very inconvenient, but I put politics aside to save you people from dying.
Three cheers for Woodchuck! [ALL] Hip, hip, hooray! Please, don't cheer too loudly.
The tunnel is very delicate.
 Hip, hip, hooray!  Seriously, I think it's best to  Hip, hip, hooray!  [RUMBLING] [SIGHS]  Let's cheer one more time,  just for fun!  No, please.
 Four cheers.
Why not? Hip, hip  Hooray!  No!  [RUMBLING] [SCREAMS] So turns out three cheers was probably an adequate number of cheers.
[RUMBLING]  What was that?  Just keep walking.
God, I can't wait to get home.
I don't even have a home anymore.
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all my different colored hats I never wear? Well, if you need another couch to crash on, there's always my place.
 Didn't you move in with Ralph?  Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

 In case of what?  [FAINT CHATTERING]  What was that? Whoa! Oh! [YELPS] Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn? [ANTS GASP] [CHATTERING] Did you say you're a princess?  That's just my name.

You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.
[ANT LEADER LAUGHS] My hands they're crushed.
There's no way I can dig us back out now.
Well, I can dig! Actually, no one should dig.
Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.
The slightest provocation, could cause another collapse that would crush us all.
[ALL GASP] I know that because I bought a sitcom about fracking, The Frack Shack.
It's New Girl meets fracking.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, God, no one's gonna watch that show, huh? [GROANS] Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.

 I'll assign team leaders.
 Oh, no.

Um  God!  For you, a banana  because you're so appealing.
 Yeah.
And for you, a radish.
Enjoy.
Mr.
Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.
I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.
 And who made you the food captain?  Woodchuck.
Exactly.
He's in charge.
Excuse me, you have not been allocated those rations.
I'm a horse.
I need more food, and I'm a celebrity.
 Everyone down here is a celebrity.
 Not the caterers.
Relinquish the food.
Hey.
Here's your chance.
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.
This man has already reached his allotted food portion for the day.
Who said we have to go by your rules? Yeah, who made you leader of underground? I'm just gonna take all this and You've appointed me.
Yes, I under citizens, look Keep it together.
[GRUNTS]  Weird stuff going on downstairs.
 [CLICKING] Humph.
 I can't believe this is my life.
 Uhoh.
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze? I'm trapped underground and it's all my husband's fault and I'm gonna die in this mansion in a mass grave with his exwives.
Okay.
But on the bright side Look, Mr.
Peanutbutter loves you, you got a cool job, you got friends.
Jesus, you're right.
Even when I was above ground, I wasn't satisfied.
Oh, my God.
I'm the problem! [SOBBING] Whoa! What the? Why can't I be happy? Am I busted? No.
It I am! I'm a pit.
I'm a pit that good things fall into! Diane, you're not a pit.
I'm a pit! [SOBBING] [SIGHS] I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.
It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.
You disappeared for a year and a half.
So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.
If you were back in L.
A.
, why didn't you call me?  I wasn't ready.
 Ready? For what? I wanted to be better when you saw me again.
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.
And even if I did get better, the best I could ever be is still just some other version of me.
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.
I need you in my life.
 Really?  You're the biggest asshole I know, and you're the only thing that makes sense to me.
[DIANE SIGHS, MOANS] People should be able to have some control over their lives down here.
 Yeah!  People need boundaries.
Leadership means sometimes being the bad guy.
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy! I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.
 That's not  That's a point for Mr.
Peanutbutter.
And I'm the good guy, so that's two points for me.
What points? There are no points.
 This is not a game!  Well, maybe there should be points.
 Yeah!  Points! People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.
Well, I'm the one who came down here to save you in the first place.
Surely I get points for that.
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.
 He's right!  What?! If you came down to save us, why are we still here? [ALL] Yeah! You had one job, and you couldn't do it!  Yeah!  That's right.
Minus point for Woodchuck.
I implore you not to fall into a mob mentality.
 He called us a mob! Let's kill him!  Yeah! Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy is as broken as his hands.
That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.
An outsider like me, the guy whose house this is.

But what if dentists had a friendlier face? Ooh! What if you could take your kids to a dentist's office where all the dentists were clowns?  What?!  Kids love clowns!  Do kids love clowns?  Actually Don't they? Who else would clowns be for? Because adults don't love clowns.,Humor
That is true.,Humor
Adults find clowns creepy and offputting.,Humor
"So kids must love clowns, because otherwise, why would there be clowns? That is sound logic.",Humor
Okay.,Humor
"I want these clown dentists laughing maniacally as they drill into the teeth of America's children, starting yesterday! As someone who does have children, I have to say, a lot of kids are actually terrified of clowns! Are they? Hm.",Humor
That would have been helpful information before I committed.,Humor
"But my word is my bond and I already said yes, didn't I? Okay, so do we find dentists and train them to be clowns, or do we get clowns and train them to be dentists? Why don't we get clowns and dentists and they can train each other? Oh, somebody call the police department, because you are on fire! Aw, jeez.",Humor
"And without missing a beat, I say, ""Well, when life gives you lemons, make an Arnold Palmer.",Humor
" It's been so wonderful getting to know you all these last few days.
We're so happy to have you.
Now, let the festivities begin.
 Sissy, hand out those cat ears.
 Cat ears?  And this is for you.
 I want those.
See, the feast is about remembering the ancient tale of a heroic mouse named Squeaky.
And we always start by wearing cat ears and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy, the cat tyrant, King Pusspuss.
Looks like Princess Carolyn won't need any cat ears to look evil.
Okay, that's actually a stereotype.
Cats do take baths.
Darling, licking yourself does not qualify.
Aw, come on, it was funny.
Oh! Right in the cat gut! Hooray! Sorry, it gets a little graphic.
I really wish you'd told me your family's holiday was so anticat.
It's just an old story about one bad cat.
It's not about every cat.
 Death to all cats!  Whoohoo!  All right!  I forgot about that part.
It's kinda like church.
You say the words so many times, you forget what they mean.
Ohhh  Agh!  Hello, Hollyhock.
Oh, come on.
Wait there.
There's a spare bulb in the kitchen.
I've been sitting in that chair for five hours waiting to do this.
Agh, damn it! Sonofa! What?  Hello, Hollyhock.
 What are you trying to do? I'm trying to keep you out of trouble with a showman's flair for the dramatic.
I texted you I was gonna be home late.
You don't tell me when you're home late.
This is my house.
You need to ask permission.
 What? You're not my dads.
 I'm just looking out for you.
You spent four days with this kid, I'm worried There's nothing to worry about! We like each other.
Yeah, now.
But come on, Hollyhock.
He's a teenage boy whose job is to be around hot women in skimpy outfits all day.
You think he's gonna want What? No, I just mean that What, you think I'm not attractive enough for him? Well, you're the one who said you were a blob.
 Do you think I'm a blob?  No.
What kind of person calls his own daughter a blob?  You said blob.",Humor
"  I said I felt"" like a blob.",Humor
Do you think I'm a blob? I just I just think L.,Humor
A.,Humor
is a superficial town and you need to be careful.,Humor
"Well, Miles likes me just the way I am.",Humor
And that's the kind of person that I want to spend my time with.,Humor
"Hollyhock, wait.",Humor
Wait.,Humor
Wait! I get it! It's my weight! Yeah I'm sorry about all that.,Humor
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats? They don't hate cats.,Humor
Now I get why you didn't want to tell your family about the baby.,Humor
"Okay, I was a little nervous.",Humor
But they'll come around.,Humor
"Besides, what am I supposed to do? They're my family.",Humor
And what are me and Philbert?  Oh Can't believe she's still pissed.,Humor
"You shouldn't have called her a ""blob.",Humor
" I'm a blob too! We're both blobs! How about just as a general rule, don't ever call a woman a blob? Never! What if I meet a woman whose name is Barbara Lob? And I call her B"" for short.",Humor
"B.
Lob.
 Maybe instead of figuring out the woman blob workaround, you should just tell Hollyhock you're sorry.",Humor
I still think Miles is up to something.,Humor
Why is it so hard for you to believe someone could genuinely like your daughter? Because she's like me! Okay.,Humor
"Do you think maybe this could be more about you than it is about her? Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work to do on myself.",Humor
Everyone knows that.,Humor
But the important thing right now is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.,Humor
"Try to stay on topic, Diane.",Humor
"Well, an open conversation about your concerns with No, that's too Dianey.",Humor
She'd never buy it was coming from me.,Humor
Then why do you want my advice? I got it.,Humor
"If I can somehow prove to her what a jerk Miles is, then she'll have to like me more by default.",Humor
That's the BoJack way.,Humor
"BoJack, no! Oh oh Ooh, that's that's nice.",Humor
"Goldie, how would you like to advance to the final round? I would do anything, and I mean, anything.",Humor
So I did it.,Humor
I had sex with the PA.,Humor
"You had sex with him? That's what you wanted, right? I just said ""seduce"" the PA.",Humor
"Doesn't that mean have sex with him? No, I just wanted you to, like, get him all hot and bothered.",Humor
Eh?  And ready to sleep with you.,Humor
Then once you get him on audiotape  saying that he would sleep with you  What? come up with some excuse to get out of there with virtue intact.,Humor
That's a lot of specifics you just assumed I would know.,Humor
"Okay, well, the important thing is, we got him now.",Humor
Tell Miles what you told me.,Humor
I had sex with the PA.,Humor
"What PA? I think his name was ""Eggberg""?  What? Not him?  That's the intern.",Humor
"You said ""PA.",Humor
"  Did you think I was a PA? Nice! Why'd you want her to sleep with me? Not sleep with.
You told a contestant you would advance her to the final round if she slept with a PA? I said seduce.",Humor
" There is a distinction.
We make a show about empowering women and lifting them up, and you cheapen it with this coarse vulgarity.
I cannot lie.
You disgust me.
This was all a big misunderstanding.
Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.
You're not fit to judge anyone's character, or their booties.
So it is about judging booties.
 Hey, BoJack.
 Miles.
Don't want me dating your daughter, you could have told me.
I'm sorry.
Maybe we could've worked out some sort of deal.
What do you mean? All right, so I got this screenplay, and I think it's a really fresh area.
It's about a production intern who wants to be a writer.
Oh, wow.
I think it could go somewhere if it got in front of the right person.
So if you have like an agent or a manager you could give it to, that would be awesome, and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.
I promise.
So you were right.
He was a dirtbag.
Yeah.
I was kinda hoping I was wrong for once.
If it makes you feel any better, you were wrong about all the other parts of this.
Diane, you are so bad at making people feel better.
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock? She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.
But for now, if she believes someone can love her for who she really is, then why would I take that away from her? BoJack, you gotta get one of these massages.
 Ohhh!  Okay.
 Goodbye, darling.
 It was good seeing you.
 It was so much fun seeing you both.
 Thank you for hosting us.
It was so nice to get away for the week and learn all about your charming little traditions that didn't freak me out at all.
Byebye! Did our little city mouse have a nice time in the country? Everything was wonderful.
And your little companion was darling For a week.
But I do hope the next one you bring home knows how to appreciate a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.

Woodchuck has no idea what he's up against.,Humor
"You're right! But are we sure this is the right thing for us? If I jump right back into politics, that's not gonna give me a lot of time to focus on our burgeoning clown dentistry business.",Humor
Then it is definitely the right thing for us.,Humor
This is an abomination.,Humor

He's right.,Humor

I was married to both Jessica and Katrina.,Humor
I know them inside and out.,Humor

What are you doing?  Seeing how fast I can change channels.,Humor
"Also, I found all the loose change in the house and I put it in alphabetical order by year.",Humor
Do you really think a guy like Miles couldn't ever really like a girl like me? No.,Humor
I was just jealous because you were spending a lot of time with him.,Humor
He hasn't texted me all day today.,Humor
I've been trying to distract myself.,Humor
Forget him.,Humor

Mrs.,Humor
TeachBot.,Humor
Ugh.,Humor
My greatgreatgreat grandmother was called Princess Carolyn.,Humor
She was an agent and a manager in Hollywoo.,Humor
What's the difference between an agent and a manager? Both look to find projects for their clients but only managers can produce.,Humor
[CLASS MURMURING]  What? My mom told me that I come from a long line of strong female cats.,Humor
Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12 and it made her one of the toughest.,Humor
"Mom said, ""She could take a lickin' and keep on tickin'.",Humor
" This expression refers to clocks, an old fashioned way of timekeeping before we all universally accepted the bean system.
[CLASS] The bean system is the way.",Humor
" For Ancestry Day, I'm gonna tell you a particular story about one particular day on which Princess Carolyn faced and overcame particular adversity all the way back in the year 2017.
 [RUTHIE] The day began like any other.
 [GROANS] [RUTHIE] Princess Carolyn lived with her boyfriend, Ralph.
 She was pregnant and very happy.
 [SIGHS] Sorry I can't go with you to the doctor.
 Don't worry about it.
I feel great!  Today is crucial.

How about National Friend of a Friend Day?""  Is that anything?  You'll think of something.",Humor
[SLURPS] Mm! Give me just a sip of the coffee.,Humor
I can have a sip.,Humor
One sip.,Humor
Today is going to be great.,Humor
Oh! [YELPS]  Hey.,Humor
[MOANS] Ohhh! [RUTHIE] She was wrong.,Humor
Today was gonna suck.,Humor
"[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [RUTHIE] Princess Carolyn started her day with a call to BoJack Horseman, her former clientslashlover.",Humor
Ruthie! Inappropriate!  Sorry.,Humor
[BOJACK] Go for BoJack! You like that? I'm trying out some new phone stuff.,Humor
"Or is ""Bo for GoJack"" better? Nah, maybe too clever.",Humor
I don't want people to think I'm trying.,Humor
"Sorry, who is this? Princess Carolyn, moron.",Humor
"Oh, hey, P.",Humor
C.,Humor
"So what do you think?  About what? ""Go for BoJack!"" Or maybe Ugh, stop! You need to get a new agent.",Humor
I'm sick of fielding your offers.,Humor
"Offers? Well, you tell them that I am not doing another reality show.",Humor
So degrading.,Humor
"All they had at craft services was Kirkland snacks, P.",Humor
C.,Humor
Kirkland snacks.,Humor
"Well, first of all, I don't work for you, so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.",Humor
"But, second, these are actually good offers.",Humor
Really? Like what?  I'm not telling you because Got it.,Humor
"Busy, busy.",Humor
"I'm busy too, so I'll call you back later.",Humor
Bye.,Humor
Don't call.,Humor
"I don't work for you! How's this for a headline for the blog? You write about this, quote, ""BoJack Finally Solves Mystery ""of Hollyhock's Mother"", comma, ""Looks Handsome"", colon "": Is Cool.",Humor

I still don't understand your plan, or how that's a headline.
The plan couldn't be simpler.

They're not just gonna give you the birth certificates.,Humor
"Well, I gotta try something.",Humor
"I have this girl at my house who came to me for help, I want to do right by her.",Humor
"I just don't know if you've thought through Diane, I am a famous.",Humor
They will give me the birth certificate.,Humor
Everyone gives me everything I want all the time.,Humor
"It is an existential curse, but a huge daytoday convenience.",Humor
So why do you need me?  I don't know.,Humor
Just wanted some company.,Humor
"You told me to use a vacation day because this was, quote, ""a feminismrelated emergency.",Humor

[RUTHIE] But today was all about business.,Humor
"She was there because she was trying to get her client Courtney Portnoy cast in Corpse ""Me If You CanCan"", the 1940's Cannes, Franceset story of a cancan dancer who contracts cancer but continues to cancan as a canny cadaver who plays the accordion with Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Kline, Chris Klein, Chris Pine and Chris Kattan.",Humor
Got it.,Humor
[GASPS] Gekko.,Humor
"Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.",Humor
"Is it new, or something I've seen you wear literally hundreds of times? [RUTHIE] Normally, Princess Carolyn would've been rattled, but that day, she realized Vanessa Gekko no longer had any power over her.",Humor
"In truth, the woman had challenged and inspired Princess Carolyn, not only to be a better agent, but to be brave enough to try and have it all.",Humor
"Princess Carolyn wanted to tell her thank you, but instead she said  You look tired, ""Veronica.",Humor
"  Oh, I Amazing burn, Princess Carolyn.
Hey, Princess.
We have a little snag.
Did Chris Kattan drop out? Right before his comeback? Right when the world is finally ready to settle for Kattan?  No, it's  You're fired.

We'll talk later, right? I'm so sorry.

Did you have a good meeting? [MOCKINGLY] Did you get fired? [GROANS] Aw.
Sorry you got fired.
Here's a latte.
Oh, uh  It's decaf, ma'am.
 Thanks, Judah.
You know, one year ago, a setback like this would have really spun me out.
But I don't need Courtney.

Great.
What's next? I noticed your necklace was broken, so I pushed back your appointment, and found a reputable jeweler nearby.
Don't know what I'd do without you, my hairy number two! Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That came out horribly.
Not to speak above my station, but perhaps it would behoove us to entice BoJack Horseman back into our stable.
 Ugh!  I'm sorry, ma'am.
Stable"" and ""behoove"" were poor word choices.",Humor
"I was not trying to engage in punnery during business hours, but we've received 15 more inquiries about BoJack just this morning, and I don't think it's wise to look a gift opportunity in the mouth.",Humor

Typical politics! Hey.,Humor
"So I need this clasp replaced, 24karat gold.",Humor
This is a priceless family heirloom.,Humor
"Princess Carolyn had gotten her necklace from her mother, who got it from her mother, who brought it from the old country.",Humor
"When our ancestors first emigrated to America, they were very poor.",Humor

"Oh, yeah.",Humor
Good for you.,Humor
I'm so proud of you.,Humor
Your approval means nothing to me.,Humor
"So I guess it's good you said ""no"" to my offer last year.",Humor
"What offer? I mean, exactly what offer are you talking about? I get so many.",Humor
"Last year, I reached out to your guy I wanna say, ""Judo""  Judah.",Humor
This guy's name was Judo.,Humor
I offered to buy VIM and merge it with Vigor.,Humor
"We would have called the new company, VIMgor.",Humor
"Oh, right.",Humor
That offer.,Humor
I couldn't believe when he said you weren't interested.,Humor
"Well, yeah.",Humor
"Because I wasn't, and he does what I say.",Humor
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.,Humor
"You got to start over as a manager, and instead of buying VIM, I bought the Utah Jazz.",Humor

Hello.,Humor

"No, I won't.",Humor
"Very astute, ma'am.",Humor
It was Charley Witherspoon!  Mmhmm.,Humor
Char ley  Hmm? Hmm!  Wither spoon!  Hmm.,Humor
Okay.,Humor
How does that make you feel? That very short story makes me feel nothing.,Humor
I don't think it's your fault as a storyteller.,Humor
I often have trouble engaging with narratives.,Humor
[RUTHIE] His lack of response made her hope it wasn't true.,Humor
"Could it all have been a misunderstanding involving an enigmatic stranger named ""Judo""? So, what's next, then? Ooh, I want to get the life rights to that woman I saw on Instagram who had a pretty coffee.",Humor

Where do we get a number?  That line.
 What? And you'll need these [GRUNTS] forms.
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper? Can't I just swipe an app or something?  Bye, Diane! Keep up the great work!  [GIGGLES] Oh, get over yourself.
 [SIGHS]  [DOOR OPENS]  So? What's the prognosis?  Hmm I'm trying to think of the best way to put this.
As Charles Lindbergh would say, Sometimes you fly an airplane, and sometimes you lose a baby.",Humor
" In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.
Wait, what? Your pregnancy is no longer viable.
Well, how do we make it viable again? Mmmm How did this happen? Goodness, I don't know.
I wouldn't beat yourself up.
Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.
There's nothing medically wrong with you.
Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.
Maybe you didn't deserve it because you were unkind once.
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster God or wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.
Oof! This is A lot.
Not for me.
This is my job, so  Pretty regular day.
 What do I do next? Well, there's a procedure.
We can do it here later this week.
You want Darlene to call someone to drive you home? No, I'm okay.
I don't need anyone.
You're a real tough broad.
Except for, you know, the uterus area.
Pretty weak.
[GASPS]  Hey, is my necklace ready?  Oh, I was going to call you.
When I was working on your necklace, I realized something.
 Oh?  It's not actually gold, it's just gold plated.
See? No, it's very expensive.
It's pretty, but basically worthless.
And I'm only saying it's pretty to make you feel better.
But, it's from the old country.
It's been in my family for generations.
No, this is costume jewelry from J.
C.
Penney.
Circa 1963.
Somebody just told you a story.
 I'm sorry.
 Wha huh? So, do you still want a 24karat gold clasp on this garbage necklace, or? [SNIFFLES] Ohhh! [GASPS, SOBS]  [RINGTONE PLAYS]  Oh! Ralph, hey! Hi, honey.
Just checking on how the doctor's appointment went and also to wish you a happy Acknowledge Your Gardener Day.",Humor
" It's a work in progress.
Don't judge.
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.
I'm actually just walking in now.
Oh, hello.
Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn, here for my appointment.
I like your perfume.
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.
You sure it's okay I'm not there with you? Ralph, it's fine.
I'm a big girl.
Everything is so easy with you, Princess Carolyn.
I mean, that's why I love you.
Yeah, easy.
[CHUCKLES] That's what the boys in high school liked about me, too.
[CHUCKLES] Okay, I'll see you tonight.
 I love you.
 I love you, too.
[BEEPS] [SIGHS] [SLURPS, MOANS] Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.
Do you need anything else before I go? No.
Thank you.
Should you be drinking that? You don't always know what's best for me, Judah.
Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn? Charley Witherspoon made you an offer to buy Vim, and you went over my head and turned him down without telling me.
 Oh.
 So it's true.
 You lied to me.
 Yes.
Because you didn't want to work at a big agency.
 You don't fit in with other people.
 I You're weird, so you'd rather stay here where you have all the power.
No, Princess Carolyn So you lied to me, and you made me look like an idiot! I was trying to protect you.
If you heard, you'd feel like you had to say yes.
I don't need you to protect me.
If you had time, you could decide what to do next on your own terms, which you did.
Well, that's not your decision to make.
Princess Carolyn, I understand you're upset.
 And perhaps your emotions  No.
If I can't trust you, then I can't work with you.
You're fired.
[SIGHS] Thank you for my time here, Princess Carolyn.
It's been very pleasurable.
Until now.
This part is Sad.
Don't forget, you have reservations at 8:00.
 Thank you, Judah.
 Good night.
Ruthie, this story has gotten really dark.
It has a happy ending.
I promise.
Well, can we get there soon? This assignment was supposed to be six beans long.
You've already gone on for eight beans.
Okay.
I'm almost finished.
But first, let's check in with BoJack and Diane again.
What have they been up to? [BEEPING] Error.
Error.
I'm not leaving without the certificate! I danced your dance, lady.
I filled out that form.
But I will not wait in this line anymore.
Not one person in here offered me a Fiji water, and I am parched from all the yelling I've been doing! BoJack, let's go home.
No, I would like to register a formal complaint.
 How do I do that?  Complaints are on the eighth floor.
But you need to fill out an application for a complaint registration, which you can get by waiting in line 12B on the third floor.
You have won this round.
So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.
But she didn't know how to tell him what had happened or how he'd take the news.

So you were lying earlier at dinner? Is that what you're upset about? That I lied? About losing the baby? About keeping my apartment? I lied? That's the big sad thing that happened? Trying to process what you threw at me.
It's gonna be fine.
I'll be pregnant again in no time.
I'm so sorry.
Let me take you home.
 When you're ready to try again  I'm ready!  I said I was ready.
 Okay.
So we'll go back to the doctor, maybe talk about other options.
I don't need other options.
My mother had 12 kids.
My body was made for this.
We just gotta keep tickticktickin'.
Princess Carolyn, I know you wanna do this on your own, but you've had two miscarriages now, and  Five!  What? I've had five miscarriages.
One last year, now one, and three others before.
 But it's whatever.
It's okay.
 Why didn't you tell me? Are you kidding? I don't want you looking at me like that.
Like that! I know I can do this.
You can't keep stuff like this from me.
It's not okay.
 It's not about you.
 It is.

You're not allowed to be mad at me.
 This is my bad day.
 It's our bad day.
It's so easy for you  To love me when everything's good.
 Princess Carolyn, I  Let me take you home.
 No.
You need to live in this.
You need to get used to this, because if you're serious about having a baby with me, this could happen again.
Are you prepared for that? This could happen five more times.
But I'm ready for that.
Because I want this.
Do you want it that bad? [SIGHS] I just think we should maybe talk about other options.
Okay.
Here's another option.
 Get out of my apartment!  I'm sorry.
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.
The one you can take home to your parents.
The one who's easy.

I started this all wrong.
 How was your day?  [MOANS]  Well  Because mine was awful.
I mean, truly, one for the books.
Because I'm a good guy trying to do the right thing.
First, I go for my breakfast Pinkberry, which I had earned because I had good intentions for today, they're out of my favorite toppings! So I go across the street to Menchie's, like some kind of hobo.

If this were October, you could market your venture as some sort of spooky Halloween experience, but since this is January, a month which, to my knowledge, contains no Halloweens, I have no choice but to Wait! Wait.
What if my clown dentists put on a show? A delightful, whimsical, nonterrifying clownstravaganza? You would have to agree we were a legitimate business then, right?  Go on.
 Give us a week.
We'll put on a show.
If you don't laugh, I'll dissolve the business and release all my clown dentists into the woods, where they'll never bother anyone again.
All right.
You have one week to create a show that delights and astonishes me.
But I should warn you, I am a very tough crowd.
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party and I did not find him charming.
Ooh! Excuse me.
 Get outta my way.

It's sad.
Well, some would argue that sad and funny are two sides of the same coin.
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln and some weird flat house are two sides of the same coin.
Take five, Picarello.
I've got a week to whip these dentists into clowns.
But they're just not silly or wacky or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind! Should you be drinking that? Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.
Might as well get blotto, right? Um, shouldn't you be at work? I'm recalbibrating.

 Father?  Yes, darling? Am I to die? Well, eventually yes, but this illness is but a hiccup in what will be a long and happy life,  I promise.
 You promise? In fact, some good may yet come of this.
Doctor says your throat is nearly swollen shut.
So perhaps you'll finally lose some of that weight that's given you such troubles.
 Won't that be nice?  Yes, Father.
 Ow!  Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.
Polly, be a darling and fetch me a pretty pill and a glass of water, won't you? Yes, SeÃ±orita Sugarman.
Beatrice, you're looking well, which is just fine, because your debutante party is vitally important.
Will it end poverty, war and injustice, or bring back civil rights activist Medgar Evers, who was shot in Mississippi this week? Yes! Or rather, it will end you worrying about that nonsense because it will land you a husband.
At least Evers' death means no one else will be assassinated this year, 1963.
The FBI is on too high alert to allow anything like that to happen again.
 Hmm?  Yes well Your chaperone, Corbin Creamerman, is a fine young man.
Oh, Jeez.
My lady.
 Here you go.
 Thanks.
So uh, you look nice.
Thank you, Corbin.
That's the third time you've told me.
You needn't tell me again.
Oh, Jeez.
I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at these things.
But sometimes I am.
I can be.
I I really try to be.
I'm, well, I I'm not.
I'm really not.
I don't know why.
Ah, that's all right.
I'm not either.
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman, is founder of Creamerman's Creamy Creambased Commodities.
Think of all the free iced cream you could, uh, serve to other people.
Father, do you aim to marry me off to Corbin Creamerman merely because it would be good for business? Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas of how a Sugarman/Creamerman alliance might be advantageous.
 Uhhuh.
 For example, imagine a television advertisement with a fun jingle.
Have your morning coffee or tea With Sugarman and Creamerman But save some for these fellas And then it's Mort and me, and we're holding up our products with big smiles from across a very ordinary looking kitchen table.
Father, common Americans don't want you on their TV sets.
You're a reminder of the disparity of wealth in this country.
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.
You know, I sent you to Barnard to get your MRS from a fine upstanding Columbia man, but instead of a bachelor you returned home with a bachelor's degree and a mouth full of sass.
What a waste!  You look nice.
 Thank you.
Oh, my Beatrice Sugarman? Doth my eye belie me? Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.
Why are you here? I must say, it's tremendous you're finally debuting.
Better late than never, hmm? Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father, who has very oldfashioned ideas about how a woman is to live her life.
Poor Corbin here is saddled with chaperoning me.
Oh, I don't feel saddled.
In truth, I find these parties to be garish, selfserving wastes of money.
Oh, and I'm sure yours was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.
Oh, my! How repugnant! Uh Scotch on the rocks.
Do I know you? Nope, just crashing some dumb debutante's party.
Oh, do you mean for dumb"" to describe the party or the debutante? Because I might agree with you, or I might be offended.",Humor

It's a phenomenal script which may or may not involve ghost or newts.,Humor

"It's this gritty, hardboiled mystery  Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.",Humor

Matthew Perry?  Yeah.,Humor
But I was thinking Hold on.,Humor
"Matthew Perry Hey, BoJack, which one of these pictures more says, ""This daughter looks like a cool ""lady that I wanna have in my life""?  Why do you ask?  I'm writing a letter to my mom and I want to include a picture.",Humor

" I'm talking to you.
 [HORNS HONKING]  [TIRES SCREECHING] Can you not start and stop so much? I can't control the traffic, darling.
When the car in front of me starts, I start.
 And when it stops, I stop.
 Maybe you don't have to start every time the car in front of you starts, because you know it's gonna stop again anyway.
You could leave a little space.
 Okay.
 [ENGINE RUMBLES] And another car just cut in front of me because I left a little space.
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.
Okay.
I'm gonna get some gas.
All right.
I got the lowdown.
First of all, very important, I got you this flattened penny.
I will cherish it always.
 I'm sorry for being annoying before.
 Don't worry about it.
Here's the deal.
With this traffic, we can stay on our current trajectory and get to Hawaii just in time to spend two luxurious hours at the Honolulu Stilton, and then turn around and come back, or we can hang out here at the Thrifty Lodge at this charming halfway to Hawaii rest area and gas park.
Excuse me, we would like your finest room, please.
All our rooms are the same.
What kind of cuisine is on premises? There's a deli at the gas station across the street.
 And what are your spa hours?  There's no spa.
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala, could I use your grand ballroom for that, or is that booked months in advance? I could settle for a Demiballroom in a pinch, but attire will be formal, I don't wanna upstage the venue.
We have zero ballrooms in this Thrifty Lodge.
I see.
This will do nicely.
Didn't you tell me once you always wanted a ballroom? Actually, no.
[CHUCKLES] What I wanted was a Belleroom.
What is that? Like a room full of bells? It's a room full of big books, with big windows and a ladder, like Belle got in Beauty and the Beast"".",Humor
And it's called a Belleroom?  It's called a library.,Humor
But I called it a Belleroom because it was magical.,Humor
"And since it was a name I made up for a room that wasn't real, that meant that it was just mine.",Humor
That's adoraBelle.,Humor
"[WOMAN] Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn!  What's that? You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right? Ha! That's right.",Humor
"Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie? That's like a shellfish version of a selfie.",Humor
"Hmm?  Go, take a picture.",Humor
It'll make their day.,Humor
You sure? You don't mind?  I'll be in the room.,Humor
Don't stay out with your new friends too late.,Humor
"Hey, guys.",Humor
I'm coming down.,Humor
"What other of my things do you like? [MAN] Wow, yeah! Okay, so [SNORING] Oh.",Humor
Hey.,Humor

 [POUNDING ON DOOR]  Huh?  Hey!  I need to talk to Hollyhock!  She's not here.
 You have to let me see her.
Please, I flew all the way here and it's Wichita, so it's not like I got other shit to do in Wichita.
No one told you to come here.
You're the one who likes foreign movies, right? That part in Amelie"", where she listens to the guy's story? This is that part.",Humor
And I'm the guy with the story.,Humor
And I need you to be Amelie right now.,Humor
I don't like foreign movies.,Humor
I like foreign films.,Humor
"Okay, you're impossible.",Humor
"The rest of you, please, just listen for a second.",Humor
I know you hate me.,Humor
"But for Hollyhock, please, listen.",Humor
"[CLEARS THROAT] Whole time she's staying with me, it doesn't make sense, right? If I'm her father, where is her mother? Well, that's an extremely heteronormative way  of looking at things.",Humor
"No, I'm saying, medically, where is the woman I had sex with that made her be born? Right? That's why Hollyhock came to L.",Humor
A.,Humor
in the first place.,Humor
"Okay But then I thought, ""What if I'm not her father?"" You're not her father.",Humor
We are her fathers.,Humor
You're her fathers.,Humor
Yeah.,Humor
"I know, I know.",Humor
"Eight of you, each have your own cute thing, I get it.",Humor
"My point is, Hollyhock and I have the same DNA, but that doesn't mean I'm her father.",Humor
You're not.,Humor
"Because being a father isn't just God, I feel like you are willfully misunderstanding me.",Humor
"What I am saying is, I'm not even her father biologically.",Humor
Excuse me?  My father is her father.,Humor
What?  Huh? [BOJACK] I went to every hospital and clerk house in L.,Humor
A.,Humor
"I waited in lines, filled out forms, talked to anyone who would talk to me.",Humor
I wouldn't rest until I knew I'd done everything I could.,Humor
"But there was no record of a little horse girl born on Hollyhock's birthday Okay, so? in L.",Humor
A.,Humor
", because Hollyhock wasn't born in L.",Humor
A.,Humor
She was born in San Francisco.,Humor
I got a little bug in my brain that my father knocked up the help.,Humor
"So I went up there, and I did the whole thing again, and I found it.",Humor
"The birth certificate with her mother's name, clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.",Humor
"That's  But where is she now, right? Looked her up on Facebook.",Humor
"I know what you think: ""BoJack Horseman has a Facebook account?"" Obviously, I didn't, because the Internet is for nerds.",Humor
"But I know it's a good way to find people, so I set up an account, and I found her.",Humor
She lives in Minneapolis.,Humor
She's a nurse.,Humor
Her phone number was on her Facebook page.,Humor
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.,Humor
You did all that?  She has to know.,Humor
You don't have to tell her I was here.,Humor
I'll stay out of her life forever.,Humor
You can tell her I'm an asshole.,Humor
Say you found this on your own.,Humor
"I don't care, but you have to tell her.",Humor
Please.,Humor

"What? You want me to do it, I'll do it.",Humor

"Eh, it'll be good for me to get out of the house anyway.",Humor
You want a drink?  Water.,Humor
"Water? ""Water"" you pregnant? [CHUCKLES] Very much not so.",Humor

I heard you had a kid living with you? No.,Humor
She's got these adopted dads.,Humor

Like what?  I don't know.,Humor
I'm sorry.,Humor
This is great.,Humor
I'm sorry.,Humor
"Why would you think I would like this? Because you told me this is what you always dreamed of? I don't like big gestures like this!  How many times have I?  Yeah, but this is This was a fantasy, something that belonged to me.",Humor
Why couldn't you have asked me  I'm sorry.,Humor
"I'm sorry I ever try to surprise you, or do nice things.",Humor
"Do you know how much it cost to get 5,000 fake books? So I'm the bitch? Is that what you I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home feel like a place that you would want to live that could be yours as well as mine! Why is that so important to you? Because otherwise, it feels like you're a guest.",Humor
"And unlike the talking candlestick in the aforementioned Disney film, I don't want you to be that.",Humor
It makes me feel shitty.,Humor
"Like you're just visiting here, until the next thing and you're gonna leave me when you get bored or you find something better.",Humor

I love those things.,Humor
I know.,Humor
And it's messy.,Humor

And it's hard to figure out.,Humor
"But sometimes, if you squint at it just right, everything lines up, and it's the most perfect Beautiful, amazing thing.",Humor

Yeah.,Humor
But it wasn't all bad.,Humor
"I mean, yeah, I got secretly drugged for months on end to the point I was living in a nightmare which I couldn't recognize my own body or understand what was happening to my brain, but, other than that, it was a pretty chill experience.",Humor
I should have protected you.,Humor
"I really wanted to be a good dad to you, Hollyhock.",Humor
"Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.",Humor
Yeah.,Humor
"Good thing, I guess.",Humor
Yeah.,Humor

"Is there anything, uh, I can do? I can upgrade your seats, or or send you better fruit.",Humor
"BoJack, look, I never needed you to be a dad.",Humor
I'm going to be fine.,Humor
"I told you from the beginning, I have eight dads.",Humor
Yeah.,Humor
