I'm just gonna take all this and You've appointed me.Yes I under citizens look Keep it together.[GRUNTS]  Weird stuff going on downstairs. [CLICKING] Humph. I can't believe this is my life. Uhoh.Too much sad booze for you.Where's the happy booze? I'm trapped underground and it's all my husband's fault and I'm gonna die in this mansion in a mass grave with his exwives.Okay.But on the bright side Look Mr.Peanutbutter loves you you got a cool job you got friends.Jesus you're right.Even when I was above ground I wasn't satisfied.Oh my God.I'm the problem! [SOBBING] Whoa! What the? Why can't I be happy? Am I busted? No.It I am! I'm a pit.I'm a pit that good things fall into! Diane you're not a pit.I'm a pit! [SOBBING] [SIGHS] I can't believe I'm crying.This is so dumb.It's okay.Don't feel bad about feeling bad.You disappeared for a year and a half.So you do want to talk about it.Just took four solid days of drinking.If you were back in L.A. why didn't you call me?  I wasn't ready. Ready? For what? I wanted to be better when you saw me again.And I thought I could be somehow.But I'm not.And even if I did get better the best I could ever be is still just some other version of me.BoJack I can't wait for you to be better.I need you in my life. Really?  You're the biggest asshole I know and you're the only thing that makes sense to me.[DIANE SIGHS MOANS] People should be able to have some control over their lives down here. Yeah!  People need boundaries.Leadership means sometimes being the bad guy.You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy! I don't want a bad guy to be our leader. That's not  That's a point for Mr.Peanutbutter.And I'm the good guy so that's two points for me.What points? There are no points. This is not a game!  Well maybe there should be points. Yeah!  Points! People seem to like my points idea.That's another point for me.Well I'm the one who came down here to save you in the first place.Surely I get points for that.Asking for points is conceited.That's more points for me. He's right!  What?! If you came down to save us why are we still here? [ALL] Yeah! You had one job and you couldn't do it!  Yeah!  That's right.Minus point for Woodchuck.I implore you not to fall into a mob mentality. He called us a mob! Let's kill him!  Yeah! Folks Woodchuck's political philosophy is as broken as his hands.That is a convincing argument.He does have broken hands.Maybe it's time an outsider took control.An outsider like me the guy whose house this is.[CHANTING] Peanutbutter Peanutbutter.Peanutbutter everybody.[CHANTING] Peanutbutter!

1,"  Oh.So I guess we'd met before. That was the third time we met.The first time was when I was an intern.I delivered a script to your house.You were passed out in the yard covered in tapioca pudding.I hosed you down dragged you inside covered you with a blanket. Really? I don't remember that. Shocker.So you've gone from daughter of a maid to head of your own company.Well the company's not doing so hot. Don't try to guilt me. It's not your fault.Turns out being an agent and running an agency are two different skills.It's like asking a really delicious tomato to make you a tomato sandwich.How's a tomato gonna make you a sandwich? He's got no arms.You'll figure it out.Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.But I don't even know why I'm doing it.Does any of it matter? Why are you an agent at all if it makes you so miserable? Because I'm good at it.I mean stuff hasn't been hitting lately.But usually I'm really good at it.Just 'cause you're good at something doesn't mean you have to do it.I'm good at driving sober but I don't relish the opportunity.But what else would I do? Who else would I be? I do love you by the way.I mean as much as I'm capable of loving anyone.Which is never enough.I'm sorry.Tada! Well it is truly how should I put this? Wonderful.So you'll give Elefante a good review? Oh no I can't do that.I waited over two hours to be served.The ambience was terrible.You two were screaming all night.At one point a waiter ran through the restaurant on fire.Unfortunately you will be receiving my lowest rating: four hundred and twelve stars out of a possible a billion.A billion stars? Yes that's the rubric I use on SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com. Oh God get out. [exclaims] I assure you the animated GIFs with which I describe this encounter shall be scathing.Mom! I just touched base with Rooney re Winslow.He's out we're in.The conference room is ours.Perfect! This is the meeting where we finally convince the big boys to let us get babies addicted to vaping! Yes! Corporation! [all cheer]  How about a drink?  I could drink.I don't think I can.I'm heading out.I got pretty badly burnt earlier and in a lot of pain.I should probably go to the ER.Have a great night.[groans] Ha ha! What's the second time we met?  A taping of Horsin' Around. Which episode? The one where Olivia put too much detergent in the washing machine.[BoJack] Nancy Reagan was the guest star.That woman was the real actor in the family.[Carolyn] I just started working for Marv.I went backstage to introduce myself.And then what happened? You told me you were too tired pretending to be nice all night  and I needed to leave you alone. Oh.I'm a real jerk huh? Yeah but you're honest straightforward not fake nice and don't beat around the bush.Your heart is tender so you protect it from people but sometimes you open up a wall and it's incredible.You're doing the best you can considering your asshole parents.You have great taste in art and that pink spot on your nose is just adorable.How many nice things was that about ten?  Yeah just about. Okay one more.You let me help you tonight because you knew I needed it.You did it for me which was very sweet.Thanks.You're a good friend to me. BoJack  Yeah? Are we friends? Yeah.I mean I think we are.Or I think we can be.Okay then as a friend I'm asking you Please don't leave me. Princess Carolyn  Please.I can turn this around I just need more time.We're in a fragile period still finding our feet.Just give me six months and then you can go.I promise I'll never ask anything from you again but please give me six months.Sorry I left my coat here.[whistling a tune] [waiter] I got it.[continues whistling] So? What do you think? No.Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  I'm BoJack the Horseman  BoJack Ladies and gentlemen to announce this year's Oscar nominees Mr.Peanutbutter! Mr.Peanutbutter! Mr.Peanutbutter? Hello! Here I am Mr.Peanutbutter.That's my name and I am here.Okay the nominees.Nominees for Oscar.Who are the nominees? Well as I used to say on Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out let's find out.For Best Actor the nominees are.Jurj Clooners for The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.Bread Poot for City of AIDS.Colin Firth for First Things Firth.The Colin Firth Story.Michael Fassbender for I want to say Bill Gates? And BoJack Horseman for Secretariat.Whoa.BoJack you just got nominated for an Oscar.You're an Oscar nominee.How do you feel? I feel II feel I feel the same.It happened again.Why do I keep thinking things will make me happy?  What is wrong with me?  BoJack don't do this. Don't fetishize your own sadness. Uh Oh God I'm drowning. I feel like I'm drowning. BoJack listen.When I was 17 I snuck out to a fraternity party.The roads were icy and I swerved into the lake.I came to underwater.It was dark and cold and I didn't even know which way was up.I thought for sure I was going to drown.And then I noticed when I opened my mouth the air bubbles floated up and that's how I knew which way to swim.That is a terrifying story.BoJack when you find yourself lost and disoriented and underwater and you don't know which way is up it's important to breathe.I don't deserve this.I'm not a best actor.Awards aren't about who's best BoJack.That's literally the only thing they're about.No.All this means is that you're one of the special people.I saw it the first time I met you.You must have known it all your life.And all your life people told you that you were wrong that you weren't special that you were just like everybody else.But now the special people are saying You were right BoJack."
1,"  Okay.Okay. One two three  Abortion. Get an abortion.Oh no.We said different things.The Oscar race is heating up and all the hot stars came out to sizzle at the Golden Snowflake Awards.Step one on the 48 awards show gauntlet that is The Exhausting Road To Oscar.The nominees for best actor in a motion picture or Vine are Mitt Dermon for Midnight Hole Bread Poot for City Of AIDS Lernernerner DiCarpricorn for The Haberdasher's Peanut Jurj Clooners for The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee and BoJack Horseman for Secretariat.Oh my God.And the Golden Snowflake is Jurj Clooners.Oh my goodness.You have to be kidding me.Don't worry they'll call your name next time.My clients have won Oscars nine out of the last ten years.Nine out of ten? If you were an airline and landed nine out of ten planes you wouldn't exactly brag about that in your commercial.Everyone loves Secretariat.Your time will come.Now if you'll excuse me I have to go tell A.O.Scott how great you are.Hey yo Scott! Hey Diane. Diane Diane Diane. I'm doing my job BoJack.Young people and their phones.There could be a beautiful rainbow in this room right now and you would have no idea.Really makes you think huh?

1,"  Ow. How's life? Well the truth is that Didn't catch that but everything's cool? No.In fact I've never felt so alone Sorry missed it! You should learn to talk louder dude! Oh hey bummer about you getting the nomination but then it turning out that you didn't get the nomination.It was big news yesterday.Yeah I got royally screwed know who was there for me? No one because everyone's an asshole and the whole world sucks balls. Anyway thanks for having me over. I'm with you man.Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.Why would I make my body a temple? I've been to Temple.Temple is super boring.What do you say we go on an epic bender? Yes! Let's get higher than a stilt walker's dick!

1,"  That writes itself. You got to be kidding me.Hey where were you? We looked everywhere.You're having the Eva Braun meeting without me? I'm so sorry but I didn't know what the protocol was around here and these guys were just champing at the bit. We're just wrapping up. But Cate is my client.Okay why don't I come find you when it's over and I'll bring you up to speed? Is that Quentin Tarantulino? Yeah.I brought him on board.You know he's always wanted to direct a romantic comedy? Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.Bye.We live in a cynical world a cynical world.He's right you know.Oh ooh oh oh overrotate.Hey.I just missed an important meeting because I was babysitting Todd who's too drunk to work because you switched out the prop bourbon with the real bourbon.You are ruining my life. Have dinner with me tonight. No way.Come on just me you and a bottle of Pinot.Probably more than one bottle and some entrees.And I'll probably get an appetizer.I own the restaurant so we can go crazy. I have to work. You don't have to work. You choose to work. Hmm.Why not choose to be happy for once? Mm.When you're writing a memoir you spend a lot of time reflecting on the past.I regret not being a better friend to you and lover.Thank you.Lover's kind of a weird word but thanks.You want to get out of this stuffy old restaurant get some gelato and maybe drive out to the ocean  and put our feet in the water?  That sounds great.Let me just freshen up my whiskers.Great.I'll get the car and meet you outside.You scamper right back pussycat.You look at your reflection too long you might fall in love.She's gone.What do you want Gekko? Well I was hoping to talk to you facetoface but I guess you had to leave work early.I left at 8:30.What is it? Well Cate and I had a really good talk today.We have so much in common and especially since I'm doing so much for Eva Braun it almost seemed weird that I wasn't repping her.No.No.No no no no.No no no.She and I are both highpowered working mothers so I understand her priorities so she's switching to Gekko.Wow being a mom helped my career? I really can have it all.This isn't fair.I know everything about Cate.Her favorite color is red.Her favorite book is Suffragette City.Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.I know all I need to know which is that she's beautiful she's British and she's gonna make me a lot of money.She's Australian you moron.If you need me I'll be at work.Bye.Bye.Ugh.Uh telephone.Charlie get me Cate Blanchett.Um who is Okay I don't Uh uh sorry I can't Oh sticky.You know what? Never mind.If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate that bad she can have her.I'm gonna be okay.I'm gonna be happy.Tonight I choose to be happy.Hello?

I got your message asshole.You got something to say to me you come out to Malibu and say it to my face.I'll be alive tomorrow.After that who knows? Sorry that took me so long.Just wanted to look my best for you lover.Hey um I just got kind of a weird phone call.You and me both.Hey screw 'em all right? Yeah.Are we going to gelato? Princess Carolyn what are we doing? Getting gelato? This was a mistake.I've been acting crazy.That phone call just pulled me back to reality.You were right.I don't love you.You don't love me.We're just two lonely people trying to hate ourselves a little less.Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.Maybe that's all we ever were.Well this night took a turn.You know the worst part? I knew this was gonna happen and I let myself get excited anyway.So we agree that this is on you then? I guess I'll see you around.You're not even gonna give me a ride home? Sorry I think I just need to be alone right now.Of course of course.That's what you get when you fall for a horse.Taxi.You got to get your shit together.So yesterday you let yourself fall in love a little bit and you got your heart broken.Serves you right for having feelings.Starting now you are a hard heartless career gal.Go to work be awesome at it and don't waste time on foolish flights of fancy.From now on you are a robot.Beep bop boop blurp bleep. Hello. I just want you to know I'm fine.Uhoh.People only say they're fine when they're not fine.Did I hurt your feelings last night? I'm an agent.I don't have feelings.Well I'm glad you called.I think that you had the right idea yesterday.I should be getting back to work.Can you get me another job? Yeah well I'm not your agent anymore so no.Oh right.Well just tell whoever then.Haah! Whoa.Asshole! Anyway I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.He has cancer which as you know is a whole thing.Plus he hates me so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.Oh my God you're going to see Herb? You must be really Nope don't care.Not interested.Hope you like kicking ass Charlie because that's all we're gonna do today.My tie got stuck in the copier this morning.That's great Charlie.If you flip them real quick it looks like the tie is running.Hey Vanessa your client BoJack Horseman wants a job. Good luck. Oh yeah about that.Gwyneth came in this morning and I wanted to show her that she was a top priority so I shredded BoJack's contract right in front of her.Heh heh What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.I say good riddance to Mr.Houseman or whatever that horse's name is.It's not like he makes this company any money and he does seem to take up an awful lot of your time.I'm from Arizona Jerry.I went to Arizona State.Todd how do I turn this thing off? Todd.What? I'm busy.Never mind.Think I've figured it out.Now that I've got the room to myself time to practice the trombone.He's kind of in a bad place right now.You can't just drop him.The best agent in this building couldn't get that guy a job.The best agent in this building got him a job yesterday and I could get him a feature by the end of today.If you want to get him a movie by the end of the day great do that.Otherwise we are washing our hands of him.Charlie I hear NBC picked up your running tie show.Congratulations.Thank you Dad.Hey Marty Princess Carolyn here.How'd you like to work with the BoJack Horseman? What's that? You hate his guts? What's that? He's a talentless boob? What's that? You'll never work with BoJack again? What's that? You want him to die in an ass factory warehouse fire smothering to death under a pile of burning asses? Well if you change your mind give me a call.Oh BoJack what am I gonna do with you? I don't understand why you're going through all this trouble for him.That guy's dead weight Princess Carolyn.If you don't cut him loose you're never gonna be happy.Help me help you.That's it.Of course.Cameron Crow you skinny bitch.You know Jerry Maguire's my favorite movie of all time? All your films are so human which is super impressive since you're a crow.Well my name is Cameron Crow but I'm actually a raven so common misconception. Well whatever you are  A raven. I brought you this  Suffragette City a coming of age story about rock music being a teenager in the '80s and buying zoos""? How have I not heard of this book? You'd be the perfect director to make a movie out of it and I happen to know this is Cate Blanchett's favorite book."
1,"  Ugh! Where are you taking me? Are we going to the lake house? No we're going to a glorious magical place where they'll lock you in a room by yourself so you can't hurt anyone ever again.Oh that sounds lovely.Why are you driving so slowly?  Hurry up!  Wait.You just said Time's arrow neither stands still nor reverses after all.It merely marches forward.Isn't that right Henrietta? Yes Mrs.Horseman.That's right.Well here we are. Here?  Yes.Ugh! Halt! No entry. But I wanna slide. This is no mere slide.We three are members of an elite society of extremely young women led by I Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.You may not enter. Yeah and also you're fat. Oh! I'm not fat.Even your lungs expostulate as they struggle to expel your ample corpulence.She's saying your lungs think you're fat too.Father says I'm just growing.If you do not halt we will be forced to physically impede your egress.Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow! Beatrice stop reading and put on your uniform.Father I don't feel well.I don't care if you're scared of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle you have to go to school.Now stop making books your friends.Reading does nothing for young women but build their brains taking valuable resources away from their breasts and hips. But my throat hurts. Uniform! Now! Beatrice? Oh my you're hot.Dear Lord.Now listen here it's a mother's duty to keep her children alive and you are continually failing! How could you not have known she has scarlet fever? Say something damn it! What has become of you? I swear if I'd known this is how you'd behave once we severed the connections to your prefrontal cortex I'd hardly have bothered. Father?  Yes darling? Am I to die? Well eventually yes but this illness is but a hiccup in what will be a long and happy life  I promise. You promise? In fact some good may yet come of this.Doctor says your throat is nearly swollen shut.So perhaps you'll finally lose some of that weight that's given you such troubles. Won't that be nice?  Yes Father. Ow!  Suck in Miss Sugarman please.Polly be a darling and fetch me a pretty pill and a glass of water won't you? Yes Seorita Sugarman.Beatrice you're looking well which is just fine because your debutante party is vitally important.Will it end poverty war and injustice or bring back civil rights activist Medgar Evers who was shot in Mississippi this week? Yes! Or rather it will end you worrying about that nonsense because it will land you a husband.At least Evers' death means no one else will be assassinated this year 1963.The FBI is on too high alert to allow anything like that to happen again. Hmm?  Yes well Your chaperone Corbin Creamerman is a fine young man.Oh Jeez.My lady. Here you go. Thanks.So uh you look nice.Thank you Corbin.That's the third time you've told me.You needn't tell me again.Oh Jeez.I'm sorry.I'm not always good at these things.But sometimes I am.I can be.I I really try to be.I'm well I I'm not.I'm really not.I don't know why.Ah that's all right.I'm not either.Corbin's father Mort Creamerman is founder of Creamerman's Creamy Creambased Commodities.Think of all the free iced cream you could uh serve to other people.Father do you aim to marry me off to Corbin Creamerman merely because it would be good for business? Well I suppose I do have a few ideas of how a Sugarman/Creamerman alliance might be advantageous. Uhhuh. For example imagine a television advertisement with a fun jingle.Have your morning coffee or tea With Sugarman and Creamerman But save some for these fellas And then it's Mort and me and we're holding up our products with big smiles from across a very ordinary looking kitchen table.Father common Americans don't want you on their TV sets.You're a reminder of the disparity of wealth in this country.Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.You know I sent you to Barnard to get your MRS from a fine upstanding Columbia man but instead of a bachelor you returned home with a bachelor's degree and a mouth full of sass.What a waste!  You look nice. Thank you.Oh my Beatrice Sugarman? Doth my eye belie me? Oh Clemelia Bloodsworth.Why are you here? I must say it's tremendous you're finally debuting.Better late than never hmm? Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father who has very oldfashioned ideas about how a woman is to live her life.Poor Corbin here is saddled with chaperoning me.Oh I don't feel saddled.In truth I find these parties to be garish selfserving wastes of money.Oh and I'm sure yours was particularly horrendous Clemelia.Oh my! How repugnant! Uh Scotch on the rocks.Do I know you? Nope just crashing some dumb debutante's party.Oh do you mean for dumb"" to describe the party or the debutante? Because I might agree with you or I might be offended."
1,"  Ugh.That's your rule for every club.It's a good rule.Whoa.Whoa guys.I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.Maybe we should take our masks off and actually talk.You want me to take my mask off? Fine.Happy? I took my mask off.Did you? Because I think you're still wearing a mask.[both] Oh.Oh my God Herb you met President Clinton? Oh yeah.Many times.Did you think that I spent the last 20 years on my couch just feeling sorry for myself? I mean I did do that but I also started [coughs] a charity to bring clean water to millions of children in SubSaharan Africa.Oh wow.I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.Wait is that Charlotte? Yeah yeah.We kept in touch.You should actually give her a call.I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.She looks good for someone so old.She's three years younger than you. Exactly!  [laughs]  [coughs]  Er? Well guys I'm pretty beat.I think I need to head off to bed and I hope I actually wake up later.[coughs] And it was actually nice to see you BoJack.You can see yourselves out.[chuckling] Juice controls the media."
1,"  Vincent? Yeah Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.We've hung out a couple times. What are you ta  That dude is funny.You know he's not a person right? Look I don't want to get in the middle of your whole thing with Princess Carolyn.It's not about that.I just don't understand why nobody else seems to notice that she is dating a man who is clearly three little boys doing the thing from The Little Rascals.Oh that reminds me of another funny story.If I could say a few words? BoJack Horseman.Take the mic.Spin us a yarn.Mr.Peanutbutter Diane.Since I am friends with both of you  and have no ulterior motives  Mmhmm.I would like to offer my restaurant as a venue for your wedding.Wow! Really? I don't know.That's too generous.Hey don't look a horse's gift in the mouth right? I get it.Like the song.That's not a song.All right everyone.That's it for the toasts.Enjoy yourselves and each other.This is perfect.Now that the wedding's at my restaurant we have the home field advantage.Perfect for sabotage.BoJack I need to thank you.You calling me to the bar the other night turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I think I'm in love. Okay.This person"" you're in love with Have you seen him without his trench coat on? I don't understand why you can't be happy for me."
1,"  Way to break the fourth wall. That wasn't that funny.My name's Bryan and you haven't won me over yet. Oh Bryan. Todd in improv we get suggestions from an audience then make up scenes based on them.There are just a few simple rules.You don't ask questions.You don't say no.No matter what.When someone makes a suggestion you always try to build on it.We call that yes and"" Yes and if you mess up that's okay."
1,"  We're so in tune.We even finish each other's sentences.Sometimes it doesn't happen. It never  Happens.Ah see? I'm inside him.BoJack you haven't worked in quite some time.In fact I thought you were dead.You must be so grateful to be working again and also alive which again I thought you were not.How did you get involved with this? Well You want me to play Mr.Peanutbutter in the story he stole from me? I stole the D and then he stole my stealing of it.That makes him an idea thief which is much less cool than a thief thief which is what I am and what he also is.You know what might help? If you think about this like a professional instead of a big titty baby.This movie is a huge opportunity.Quentin Tarantulino is known for revitalizing dead careers.This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs did for Rin Tin Tin.But isn't there any other part? I could play myself.No BoJack's already being played by Wallace Shawn.What? The short guy from The Princess Bride who says inconceivable""?  Why Wallace Shawn?  BoJack Horseman? I don't want to play that boob."
1,"  Well  You know the sound guy's wife works with atrisk teens.And I was like Yeah that's okay but compared to what my wife is doing  your wife is bullshit!""  Oh."
1,"  Well what's done is done.You're happy.You didn't want me to go to New York.Lucky me I get to stay here and work on this movie that's gonna ruin my career.There's no reason to sulk about it right? Or you could sulk about it.Diane does raise some good points.No she doesn't.Besides I don't think Diane's the person you wanna be going to for life advice now.Why? Just because I've been drinking myself to sleep on your deck chairs and lying to my husband for the last week? Hey there's a CheezIt on the shelf.I knew I kept these things around for a reason. I just had the most amazing prov sesh. No one cares Todd.Hey you guys wanna help me practice? Make a suggestion. Stop. Aah.Sorry officer I didn't see that stop sign.Yes.And my car runs on farts.Ugh!  Stop.No stop it. Please stop.Not a suggestion.Okay.I just hope I impress the elder council.I want to become a Level Two so I can finally achieve clarity on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.Oh shit Todd's in a cult.What? No improv is not a cult.It's just a dogmatic school of thought taught by a forprofit organization with the promise of social and professional opportunities. Ahh. It's a cult.And I know.I learned a little about cults during that year I was a Scientologist.Coincidentally during that year I read a book about cults.Wait are you saying Scientology is a cult? No Scientology is not a cult.Improv is a cult.I wanna be very clear.This is about improv. I really don't think it's that bad guys. Why does anything matter right? Love is an illusion and happiness is fleeting no such thing as God and all your favorite musicians beat their wives.Allegedly.Would you talk to her? Yes.Yes and I am a Nazi Kardashian.Heyyy Hitler.Please stop.President Lohan! Get away from that fire hose! Fire hose! Sorry I'm late guys! Todd we take tardiness seriously here at Shenanigags. If you miss one more class you're out. I'm sorry.But wait Bryan isn't here. He's later than I am. Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.He's been negative so Copernicus thought he could benefit from some time away.He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags comedy cruise line the Giggleship. Is that a reward or a punishment?  That's up to Bryan.Let's have no more questions about the Giggleship.Oh uh all right.Well you know I was actually talking to my best friend and he said improv is a cult.I mean that's crazy right? If you think Shenanigags is a cult you're free to go Todd.Oh no.I don't wanna go.I love this place.My friend just doesn't know how great you guys are.It sounds like your friend's not yesand'ing you.Invite him to your graduation show.If he's too negative to support you you should take a good hard think about if that's the kind of energy you want in your life.I hate good hard thinks.I love you too Mr.Peanutbutter.But I I gotta go.I'm Yeah I'm building a school for deaf kids.The kids get jealous if I'm talking on the phone.Uh okay bye.So hey hi.How long are you thinking of staying here? Just for my own reference.Oh shit.Is Wanda making you get rid of me? No one is making me do anything.Except keep acting in this movie you hate.Well yeah.I really thought I could do it.I thought I could go far away and help people and be this best possible version of myself.And what happened? I couldn't.I wasn't the person I thought I was.I'd love to stay and wallow with you but I gotta head out.Today we're filming what used to be the scene where Secretariat commits suicide but is now a scene where he swims in a fishing hole  with his girlfriend Susie Side."
1,"  What a wise man. What's on the agenda my frienda? Well here's an idea.What if there was a West Dakota? Todd isn't that a job for the State Department? Well I got a whole page of other ideas each as impractical as they are prohibitively expensive.You know what they say: You gotta spend money to make money."
1,"  What is that?  What are you doing? That's the gun sounds from the song.Uh.Do you mean Brrap brrap pew pew""? Yeah that's what I did."
1,"  What the hell is going on?  I don't know Lenny.Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.All that work for nothing.Now Quentin Tarantulino's got four arms up my ass 'cause he got all excited about making a romcom.You know what would be a great romantic comedy? Remember when that guy stole the D from the Hollywood sign so he could propose to his girlfriend? That would make a great movie but who would play the lead? Preferably someone kind of washed up.You know how much Quentin loves to revitalize dead careers.It's kind of his thing.Well in that case you know who'd be great? Show me the money. Yeah. Good news.You're back in my stable and I got you the lead in a romantic comedy.Who's the best agent in the world? What? I went through hell and back today but it was worth it because I got you a job.Aren't you excited? No.I don't know.I don't care about that.You You said you wanted a job.It doesn't matter.Nothing matters. Wow.What happened in Malibu?  I got to go.Need anything else? No thanks Laura.Go home.I'll see you tomorrow.Are you gonna head out soon? Where else would I go? Happy birthday Princess Carolyn.Thanks phone.You are 40.We were young We had our heads down Oh and I I was all of a landslide Didn't know It was something to hold onto Never meant us to fall in Turn around Turn around Boxer versus raptor.Nananananananana [BoJack] Oh right.Well just tell whoever then. Haaah!  [tires screech] Ooh! [honks horn]  Asshole!  [tires squeal] Anyway I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.He has cancer which as you know is a whole thing.Plus he hates me so I could really use some good news at the end of the day.Oh my God.You're going to see Herb? You must be really Nope. Don't care.Not interested. [phone beeps] Okay Good talk.Hey. Ready for this?  Listen.I want to make sure I don't spend any time alone with Herb.I'm bringing you along as my buffer.And your memoirist.I should meet your old best friend before he dies of cancer.Fine I guess.Just don't abandon me.No bathroom breaks.And don't slip out of the room to text your fianc a bunch of winky smileys with hearts next to them Gross.Congratulations on the whole being engaged thing  by the way. Thanks.It's just starting to hit me.I'm getting married.Thank God I don't have to die alone. No offense. None taken.Till you said No offense."
1,"  What?  It turns out you made enough money to build a brand new one.So congratulations.You're a hero.A hero? That's right a hero.Or is it pronounced gyro?"" I just call them subs."
1,"  What? I can finally tell her off! I'm gonna say Look at you"" you old piece of shit rotting in a nursing home!""  Now I have the power!  That's what you want to say to her? Oh it's gonna be great! I can't wait to see the look on her face."
1,"  What? That is amazing. After six months of letters we hired a homeless guy to pretend to be Leo and take her to the homecoming dance. Look at her. Watch watch this part.I like your boutonnire.Why don't we watch this every day?  Look at her face. Now that's a good prank. I was humiliated. Yeah you wouldn't get it.It's a brothers thing right brothers? Whoo! That's Cryane for you.What a pussy.You know it's nice that years later we can all laugh about this.Yep my therapist thinks the same thing.I'm gonna go meet with the funeral director.Any of you boys want to come? Nah I ain't so big on funeral homes Deedee.All them dead bodies they give me the jeebies.Yeah Deedee why do we got to go? Fine none of you have to go.I'll take care of everything.Thank you Diane.We all really appreciate it. Come on BoJack. Why you got to take BoJack with you?! Boo!  Boo!  Boys you have stolen my heart like Dave Roberts stole second base.Hey! He knows our things! I must go now but I'll see you all at the funeral okay? And when I do you're all getting noogies. Funeral!  Yeah! Whoohoo! Funeral! Funeral! Funeral! And now a very special treat just for our platinum members.Let's take a peek at the slumbering Mr.Boreanaz himself.Get out of my room Todd! I'm David Boreanaz.Ohh! And thus concludes our tour.Have a Boreanderful day.Tell me about your father.Well he was a mean sadistic alcoholic who never supported anything I did and actively delighted in seeing me fail.Hmm I see.Sounds like you're looking for our Piece of Shit Dad Package.That would be too good for my father.Hmm I see.Might I then suggest our Piece of Shit Dad Package Would Be Too Good For Him Package. Yeah that's the one. Excellent choice.Hey can I suggest something? You might want to loosen up a little.I think you could actually learn a thing or two  from your brothers. Are you kidding? If I was like my brothers nothing would ever get done.I'm just saying if you can't find a way to let off some steam you're going to explode.God damn it! Are you god damn kidding me? I keep getting calls from this unlisted number.Ignore.Who are these assholes? Why don't you just answer and then you'll know? Oh they'd just love that wouldn't they? Ugh how are we supposed to blackmail him if we can't reach him? Maybe we got to get him where he lives?  You mean ?  That's right his house.What the Whose house is this? Is that David Boreanaz? I could've sworn BoJack Horseman lived here.Hey let's keep these lines moving huh? You want to stop and chat you gotta pay for the extended stay ticket.Ah so much so much so much.Another five Gs TBag and we are in the pink.I don't know Princess Carolyn.I ran out of shoeboxes for the money and the books aren't adding up.Plus the men's lav needs to be serviced and I had to fire Janine in the gift shop for stealing Boreabble heads.I mean how did I end up with all this responsibility? Hey I'm not screwing around here small fry. You better make those numbers sing. I don't think these offshore banks we've been using are 100% legal.Yeah well my mother told me never to slap an idiot.What? Ow! Now we're both breaking the rules.You listen and you listen good.I've gotten used to a certain lifestyle since Boreanaz House went public and I'm not going back to the old way.Mommy likes her shoes see? And her pearls.Oh I'm in too deep.I don't know what to do.I'll tell you what you should do.Who said that? It's me David Boreanaz.Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like? Uh sure.Let me give you some advice.As we say on my show I want to say New Girl? just keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine.Wow thanks Davie B.Never call me that!  Unbelievable. It's 4:00.I don't think anyone's coming.Unbegoddamnlievable! All those jerk wads had to do was show up and they couldn't even do that! Where's the body even? Beg your pardon minor hiccup.My goons went to pick your father up but nobody was home.For a nominal fee we can scrounge up another body for you.Would you care to peruse our loaner closet? Hey assholes! Where were you? I planned the whole funeral like you asked me to  and nobody showed. Yeah we realized dad wouldn't have wanted some stuffy funeral.He would've wanted his body to be chopped up into chum  and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face. Yeah suck it Jeter! Wait what? Where is Dad? We got him chummed.He's in the truck. You chummed Dad?  It's what your father wanted honey but then you wouldn't know anything about that would you? Let me get this straight.So instead of coming to the funeral that I paid for and spent all day organizing you had Dad's body ground into chum so you could throw his mushy remains on Derek Jeter? No not just on Derek Jeter.We're gonna throw it into his fat face. Yeah his fat face. In his fat face.The Yankees are in town this week.The planets are aligning Deedee.Tommy you begged me to stay and help.Why does everything always got to be about bigshot Diane?  Too good for her home. I don't think I'm too good for my home.Yeah guys you got it all wrong.Diane isn't a bigshot.She's my ghostwriter.She's writing a book that's not even gonna have her name on it.You think this is how she expected her life would be going at 34? She lives with her rich boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.She's not too good for anything. What?  Diane's a freeloader?  Even I pay rent. BoJack helping? Whoa.This is why I told you to wait in the car! Oh she snapped.Here comes Cryane.Hey hey Deedee come on.Diane you are making a public spectacle of yourself.Deedee what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.Oh come on that's Dad's truck.Dad's chum is in the back.No! No no no! Suck a dick dumb shits! Well that crazy clam did it.She took Pops.Oh no what are we gonna do? And it's a onehopper back to the pitcher.Easy out at first.So what we're gonna do is nothing? Sox are on and I haven't seen this one.Does anyone know where she might have gone? Ah she used to run off like this all the time in high school too.Who knows where crazy goes? I think I know where she went.Wait you can't leave.The party's just getting started.I don't know Diane was pretty upset  and she's got your dad. Oh don't go BoJack.You're like the fifth brother I never had. I Really?  Yeah don't leave bro.After this we'll go play touch football and do a noogie parade.Ah um Everyone please disperse.This is an unlawful gathering.Disperse immediately.Oh this isn't looking good Princess Carolyn. What are we gonna do?  What do you mean we? Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.Ha! Mr.Boreanaz I presume.Um would you like a Boreabble head? The amazing thing is the house looks just like BoJack's house.They must have the same architect.Anyway how are things with you? Not good.I should've known it was a waste of time to come back here.Oh that's awful.Well when you get back I'll give you one of my patented Peanutbutter hugs.Crunchy and creamy.You know that patent wasn't approved but I'll take it. I have to go.BoJack's here. BoJack well what's he doing ? Hey.Sorry I said all that stuff about you.It's all true isn't it? I found this letter back at the bar.I think it's for you.Look just read it.I think you'll like it.Dear Diane it's me your old pen pal Leo."
1,"  What? When I hit this button the post goes live.Diane don't.I don't want to.And I won't if you drop out of the race.Jesus Diane.You can't do that.Because you're the only one allowed to make decisions for this family? No.Because it's gonna come off as a weird lovers' spat and it's just going to embarrass everyone. Well I'm sorry if I embarrass you. Oh come on.You told me you weren't going to frack and now I can't turn on a faucet in my own home without getting thirddegree burns.Oh I get it.So like always you're mad at someone so your solution is to air your dirty laundry for everyone to see.No.This is not about us.I don't want you to be governor because you would be bad at it because you don't stand for anything.No! Hey! Don't you dare.Robert Blake gave me that mug.No! Oh you  I don't  Shut up.Take off your shirt.Frack me Mr.Peanutbutter! Frack me!Oh no.No no.No no no no no.Sorry to interrupt your lunch but there was another mass shooting.Oh God where? A town outside Tampa called Not geographically dipshit.What's the location? What is it a pharmacy? A haberdashery?  It was a shopping mall. No!  Ms.Taken is coming out next month. I know sir.The whole third act revolves around Courtney Portnoy shooting people in a mall.What are we supposed to do now not release the movie? I hope it doesn't come to that.I am sick and tired of reallife gun violence getting in the way of us telling stories that glamorize gun violence.Why does this keep happening? Has the whole world gone crazy? No we've just been conditioned by a rugged individualist culture woven into the savage architecture of our country itself birthed as it was through violent uprising but perhaps popularized in the modern imagination by stories of Okay Chomsky when I want you to talk I'll staple a string to your back and then yank it.Why not make yourself useful and schedule a sitdown with Courtney Portnoy's team to talk about how we distance ourselves from this fakakte mishegoss.Got it.Except for the foccacia Michigan part.Excuse me could you point me in the direction of an H&M? Sure.But when you get there you're gonna be DOA.Uhuh.You picked the wrong shopaholic to mess with.Because this shopaholic's also a holic for revenge. [GUNFIRE]  Die scum! [LAUGHING] Courtney Portnoyvey.[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]  Wow.Carla Mercedes Benzbrown. Yep. My mother. That's right.[CLEARS THROAT]  I lied!  What? There's no Carla Mercedes Benzbrown. I have no idea who your mother is. What? I don't want to have a relationship lying to each other.Okay so why did you lie to me? I meant everything else I said.I'll do everything I can to help find your mom.To be honest moms aren't all that great.In fact in my experience they're soulless succubi born fully formed from the ass of Satan.Oh my grandmother sounds like quite a character. Can I meet her?  Oh my mom? No you cannot meet my mom because she's dead. Oh. Dead mom.BoJack what happened to the fudgesicles I bought?  I lied again.My mom's not dead. Stop lying to me! That was like 15 minutes of lie.Plus you don't want to meet my mom.I do.Where does she live? Oh this spectacular elder care facility she has her own private room with a nice view 'roundtheclock medical care and plenty of other seniors to say casually cruel things to under a passiveaggressive veil of plausible deniability.What's this place called? I want to say Whispering Pines.Whistling Pines? Unbelievable.Something with a W.Winter's Bone?  Take me there. [GROANS] Fine!  For real this time?  Yes.I promise.I am not gonna lie to you ever again. Did you eat the last fudgesicle?  No.I lied.I lied about the fudgesicle.[GUN COCKS] All this time you thought I was just another damsel in distress  but I'm afraid you were mis guided. [GUN COCKS]  [GUNFIRE]  [SCREAMING] Oh oh. [GROANS] That is not good. Okay.Everybody set a Google Alert for mass shooting."
1,"  What's up?  Garfield's out.He got into some sort of accident.An All Hallows' Eve store in January? How fiendishly droll.Aah! Bother.The clumsy bastard broke every bone in his body and now we got to find a new lead.Studio wants to go young but I was thinking we'd get someone a little more BoJack Horseman.What? Are you serious? You're the only one with enough grit to play the part and we can age you down in post but I'm gonna tell you now not gonna put up with any woeisme bullshit or diva histrionics.I get enough of that from my exwife along with newspaper clippings about gluten.God we get it Marla.Gluten.But if you want to make a movie and you're ready to work I am.I will.I can.I do.Great.You got one month to get in shape.You need to lose 50 pounds and then gain back 20. And BoJack  Yeah? Don't ever call this number.If I want to talk I'll call you. Hey. Hey.Not big on parties? Nah.I never know what to do with my hands.I think I just got cast in Secretariat. That's amazing. It's everything I ever wanted. Yeah you seem superjazzed. What do I do now? Well that's the problem with life right? Either you know what you want and you don't get what you want or get what you want and then you don't know what you want. Well that's stupid. Yeah.I don't know if this makes you more or less excited but I actually decided to take a job on the Secretariat movie as a character consultant.Wow so we're gonna be working together again.Yeah.I hope you don't get sick of me.I don't think that's gonna happen. Is it weird I took this job?  Why would it be weird? You literally wrote the book on Secretariat.Yeah I know.I just When I first moved to L.A I thought I was gonna be doing really important work.You know writing stuff that makes a difference.But then you kind of fall into one thing and then another Well you've got time.There's always later right? Yeah I guess there's always later.Do you remember the last time I saw you? You asked me if I thought you were a good person deep down? Do I remember that? Yeah vaguely.You caught me off guard.I didn't know what to say.Well do you think I'm a good person deep down? That's the thing.I don't think I believe in deep down.I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.Well that's depressing.For what it's worth I think your writing does make a difference.Thanks.I really wanted you to like me Diane.I know.Sorry we didn't get you a birthday present.I got so distracted by trying to get tickets to the New Kids On The Block concert I completely lost sight of what's important.And I got so swept up in my campaign for class president I forgot why I was running in the first place.And I was boy crazy.Kids kids I don't need a present.I got everything I need right here.Aww. Macaroni. Sabrina.Come here you goofball. Aha. Whoa.Can you make it out to Blake? Thanks man.You're like my hero.Really? sync and corrrections by caioalbanezi Boxer versus raptor.1 Joy to the world Todd is here He drank up all your beer Oh I'm sorry did I startle you with holiday cheer and good will towards man? No I just had this terrible dream that you were a person that existed and that you were in my room for some reason.And then I woke up and it was true.Do you know what day it is? Oh shit is it like our anniversary of that one day that I forgot to tell you how annoying you are? No that was July 14th.You can remember it because it's also Bastille Day. Christ are you annoying. BoJack it's Christmas! Well don't get too excited.I didn't get you shit.Ha! Shows what you know.When you were passed out I used your credit card to buy me this new hat.Merry Christmas to me.It looks exactly like your old hat.Yeah it's my favorite kind of hat.Thanks buddy! Okay great Christmas transaction complete.Please leave now.Or we could watch Sabrina's Christmas Wish.Hard pass.What? Come on you love Horsin' Around! Yeah but I always skip the Christmas ones.Because the themes of family and togetherness are a chilling reminder of your own isolation? No but thank you for that.Todd special holiday episodes are always stupid.Cynical cash grabs by greedy corporations looking to squeeze a few extra Nielsen points out of sentimental claptrap for mushbrained idiots who'd rather spend their Christmas watching a fake family on TV than actually trying to have a conversation with their own dumb families.I like it when people on TV hug each other.Oh come on buddy! It's Christmas! Fine if it'll make you shut up I begrudgingly acquiesce to a halfhour of shared holiday acknowledgment but only because I get a residual check every time somebody watches one of them.Hurray! Begrudging acquiescence! Three little orphans one two three Without a home or a family tree Until this horse said Live with me!"" And now we've got a new family We're laughin' and learnin' and lovin' a lot Every new day is a dream We were lost and now we're found And we're Horsin' Around Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience."
1,"  Whoa! I think I just had another one. Another what? Pizza? No blackout.The thing we were just talking about. Try to keep up here. Oh Boom! Boner! Pay up! What did I tell you? That's not a boner.It's a shadow.Well I think we all learned a valuable lesson today about the Armenian genocide.The Armenian genocide was too much man! [audience laughing] All right! Next episode.Why can't life be like it was on Horsin' Around? All our issues conveniently settled in 22 hilarious minutes.You know it's amazing that it's legal for kids to be actors.How is that not child labor? I didn't know what I was signing up for. I was three. This is getting me depressed.Let's do something fun.Oh! Okay you know what really kicks ass? The planetarium! You get crazy high in the parking lot then you go in and get your mind blown by all the trippy galaxies and shit.That sounds stupid.I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.[snorting] No no no! That was drywall.Jesus we have to start marking our drugs more clearly.Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.Whoo!  [male voice] It was just so hard. Wha? What the? I was stuck in a terrifying cycle of drinking lifting my head up drinking lifting my head up drinking lifting my head up.Coffee stale donuts attention hogs telling boring stories about themselves?  Jesus! Are we at a 12step meeting?  Now you're a detective? Last night you couldn't even solve the mystery of where the toilet is.So all our partying was an elaborate trick just to get me to go sober? No Detective Pukes in the Washing Machine.You're here because I couldn't leave you alone in my house and I had to come today.Gotta get my ninemonth chip.Chip? We've been wasted for 31 hours? That's no reason for me to not get my chip.That's literally exactly the reason you shouldn't get your chip.Nowhere in the 12 steps does it say to not drink.That's not actually one of the steps.Loophole.Take a swig.If you have to listen to losers talk about their shitty sober lives it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.And I realized people don't change because they want to change.They change because they have to change.Oh God.Boo! Oh booing is generally frowned upon here.How else am I supposed to express how boring these stories are? [speaking slowly] My name is Simon and I'm an alcoholic.[all] Hi Simon.My rock bottom was when I actually woke up under a rock.Can't get lower than that.Come on! You people call yourself drunks? Most of this is stuff I do on a daily basis completely sober.Trust me pal we've done some awful things.One time I didn't want my friend to move out so I used character actress Ann Dowd to help me sabotage his hiphopera.Oh please that's baby stuff.You socalled drunks want something to feel shitty about?  BoJack maybe we should go. I got somethin' for ya.Whoa.My name is BoJack.[all] Hi BoJack.Oh like you didn't know? Anyway I once went all the way down to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew and she had a young daughter Penny.Penny Carson.That's her real name.You can look her up.I don't care.And first I tried to sleep with the mom but she said no. Then I tried to sleep with the daughter. [all groaning] Then the mom walked in on me trying to sleep with the daughter and I was like Oopsiedoopsie! Exit stage right!"" Oh God."

Sitting here? In this hotel room? (CLEARS THROAT) It's a dream come true.What's it like to play Secretariat? Dream come true.Playing Secretariat what was that like? Dream come true.(WOMAN) How long you in New York for? Just a couple days of fun interviews then it's off to Chicago for more fun interviews and then if I don't blow my brains out I get to go back to L.A.Darling you're doing marvelously I am so proud of you.If I could make one slight adjustment? Maybe fewer jokes about how these interviews  make you want to blow your brains out?  Right.Sorry.I am so thrilled to be here talking with uh Yahoo Finland.Yahoo Finland. Are you Finnish?  No we are just getting started.Walked right into that one.What would an Oscar nomination mean for Mr.BoJack Horseman? Any award recognition is just gravy.The real joy is to sit in this hotel room all day answering the same questions over and over again.Great answers you're divine.I'm in love with you.One small adjustment.I don't think sarcasm is going to read.Just write a script for me so I don't have to think for myself.Honey I would shove my hand up your ass and control your mouth like a Muppet if it would win you an Oscar.What do I know? I'm just the publicist you hired to help win you an Oscar.(WOMAN) What's it like to play Seabiscuit? I don't know.You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.(MAN) Your last attempt at a comeback was The BoJack Horseman Show.Pass.(MAN 2) People still see you as the guy from that sucky show from the '90s.Horsin' Around was not a sucky show. Yeah but it was. It lasted nine seasons.Its whole purpose was for people to watch it so the network could sell ad time so the show could make more money than it cost to produce.It did that well.It was a good show. Yes but it sucked. It didn't suck! Great job today.It could not have gone better.My only note would be stop defending Horsin' Around.Why? Millions of people loved it! We need to use these next few months to define your story.When people see you they need to think Oscar winner not dumb asshole from an old TV show that nobody cares about.Okay I hear what you're saying but we can both agree Horsin' Around was a good show right? BoJack you know I think the world of you.I think you are so smart and attractive so I'm not going to mince words.Horsin' Around was a piece of shit.(FUNKY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Looking good.Fantastic.You need a coaster.I told you to wear lipstick and underpants Teresa.I put everything billrelated in one folder.Gas bill cable bill and the new headshots for Billy Zane. Thank you Judah. You also wanted me to remind you  to call Mr.Peanutbutter. Yeah.Ping me again in two minutes? No five minutes.Uh when's our call with BoJack and Spanakopita? The one that started seven minutes ago? It started seven minutes ago.What? Diane's in your office right now stalling poorly.And that is my opinion on the Octomom.Remember Octomom? (ANA) Diane are you stalling for Princess Carolyn? What? You know who was good at stallin' was Joseph Stalin.(CHUCKLES) (BOJACK) If anything Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.Get your head out of your ass.He also had a city named after him.Isn't that right Princess Carolyn  who's been here the whole time?  Hey buddy.How was your first big day at the press junket? (SIGHS) Endless.It was like the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.He was exquisite.The movie's tracking really well on social.New media impressions are up 23 percent across platforms.What does that mean? Oh I have no idea.I assumed you would know.(CLEARS THROAT) But I keep tweeting things and they keep getting retweeted so we're doing something right.Yesterday I dropped my phone in the bathroom which made BoJack's Instagram post a picture of the floor with the caption spujb."

Feel that energy!  They don't love me. They don't know me. That's why they love you.He's right.Our research shows America likes to think they know you and then they like learning more about you but at a certain point they pass a threshold where they actually know you and then they find you weird and offputting.Are you saying that nobody who really knows me could ever love me?  No no no.Not nobody.No. No.What am I doing here?

I know you're doing important work and it's a long way to travel but I need you here and I think you should come home. Is that really what you want?  Of course it is.Well okay I'm looking at this website right now and it says if I leave immediately I can still make it home tonight. That sounds great. I love you.I love you too Diane.You know it's the funniest thing.There is a woman in this restaurant who looks just like you.I guess I just have one of those faces.Okay party people we have time for one more suggestion. Todd. Did someone say movie theater?

Stop you.With these. Oh no. Don't do anything crazy guys. You can't be serious. Just get behind me BoJack. No sudden moves.Be reasonable.You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.Especially not when I have this smoke bomb.Kapow!

Beep boop beep.No.I have a wife and children.Well they're improvised but they're real to me. Can this be the end?  This whole ship is full of idiots.Beep boop.Come on come on come on.Come on come on Todd.Almost there.Wait.Where are you going? Sorry improv is fun and great and everything but you guys are really into improv.I'm gonna go with my friend.Your friend? I didn't realize this man was your friend.Well then by all means go with him Todd.But see I thought this was the man who sabotaged your rock opera.The one who constantly abuses you and makes you shower with a hose in the yard.I invited him to.The one who's never said a kind word to you the entire time you've known him. Is this your friend Todd?  It's more complicated than that. Is it? We're your friends Todd. More than that we're a family. I uh  Hash browns. What?  I heard hash browns. Martha did you see my hash browns?  Oh my God do you ever turn it off? It was hash browns not pancakes.The first morning you stayed with me.You kept making them and I kept eating them and then I threw up in the pool.That made you throw up in the pool.Then I got mad at you for throwing up in my pool. But you said I'll clean it up."

1," [The Closer] So why did you sleep with Emily? Do you think that part of you was getting uncomfortable with that closeness? You felt like you didn't deserve Todd's friendship and you wanted to somehow externalize that feeling into action? No man I think I'm just a dumb asshole.Can't it just be that? When you do bad things you have something you can point to when people eventually leave you.It's not you you tell yourself it's that bad thing you did.Do you often keep people at arm's length? Are you afraid of being known and knowing others? Yeah you know I think that you're definitely hitting on something real that I would love to drill down into but I gotta go to this marketing meeting now.Which is so annoying because I totally want to keep talking about that thing you're talking about.But marketing meetings right? I mean they're so important.Can I call you back tomorrow?  Of course. Great.Bye. So how was your marketing meeting?  Weird. Sorry I'm late. It's fine.We're just getting started.I had the worst morning.Hanging on every word.Don't tell us.So I drove here right? I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage when I realize I don't have my key card.I gotta drive all the way home to get it.When I got there I couldn't find it anywhere.Suddenly I remember I put it in the glove compartment.It was in my car the entire time.Okay.Because I was driving back and forth so much I ran out of gas.I pulled into a 76.I was about to pump the gas I realized I didn't have my credit card when I remembered it was on my desk at home because I used it to contribute to my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.Diane Have you donated to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?  Oh shit. Throw her 50 bucks.You can afford it.Yeah but I don't like feeling like I have to Roxy.Does the world need a stopmotion short film about a pig who goes to circus school? Think of it like you're doing a nice thing for your friend.Mmm okay.I called a cab to take me home to get my credit card.Then back to the gas station get my car fill it up and come here.So that's why I'm late. Why did you tell us that whole story?  I don't know. Why did you tell me that whole story?  I don't know.Anyway I had the ad agency whip up some options for the new Secretariat ads.Good news is the movie is killing out there.Everyone loves it.If everyone loves it why do we need a new ad campaign?

1," A daring battle cry from the selfappointed New Voice of Choice.But has the concept of women having choices gone too far? We've assembled this diverse panel of white men in bow ties to talk about abortion.Gentlemen? Tom this is not just a woman's issue.I'm a man but if I got pregnant would I put my life on hold for a child I didn't want? Yes I would.I can say that with confidence because I will never have to make that decision so I'm unbiased. Does this video glamorize abortion?  Very possibly Tom.Millennials today think everything is NBD.NBD of course stands for No BD referring to B.D.Wong who teens think is a very big deal.So if something's not BD it means it's not a big deal. These days abortions are not BD. Are abortions even necessary? I heard a theory that if a woman really has an unwanted pregnancy the body has a way to break the fetus down into gas particles and then she can just fart it out.Where did you hear this intriguing fart it out"" theory?  I don't remember."

I am very famous.Time's up.Hey if you really want to know about all that stuff come by here real late.There's an afterhours party.But that's all I can say.I'm not gonna spill any more beans.Say you got BoJack with you.That'll get you in.Okay that's it.Is Wilbur coming today? Wilbur's not real.He was a character on a TV show you were on. Oh.Are my kids coming today?  Um  No. Hey there fella.Can't wait for you to see Secretariat think you're gonna love it.Hey old pal.Hope you remember how to vote.We have to go to this Whale World party.I know I should go I'm invested in figuring out who's trying to frame me for murder.Are you sure you wanna go with me? Outside of work hours? I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.Sorry about what I said.I was embarrassed by the person I was when I was staying with you.I'm trying not to be that person.I make you unhappy? Is that what you're saying? It's not about being happy.That's the thing.I'm just trying to get through each day.I can't keep asking myself Am I happy?"" It just makes me more miserable."

1," Ayeaye Cap'n.Oh I see how it is.Wanna play a game of chicken huh? I don't think this is a good idea Margo.Cram it skip! Those limp dicks are about to find out what savvy film and television viewers have known for years.Character actress Margo Martindale ain't afraid of nothin'! The boats are about to collide! We have to do something! You know damn well when we took to the sky we made a solemn oath never to meddle in the affairs of land nor sea.We are sworn but to observe.This is the blimper's promise.Oh no! The boats are tearing each other apart! Crates and crates of spaghetti are pouring out into the ocean! I'm watching the same boat collision you are.You don't need to narrate it.[screaming] Oh! No! Skippy! He was too pure for this world! Oh no! The pasta is cooking! If only we had some olive oil to reduce the stickiness.But olive oil doesn't actually reduce the stickiness in pasta.That's only a myth.No! I've wasted so much of my life stirring olive oil into pasta! Disaster al dente off the coast of San Clemente! Twelve tons of pasta have leaked into the ocean and the massive carbo load is heading straight to Pacific Ocean City.[screaming] Joining us via Google Hangout is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall. What can you tell us Carla?  Well Tom as the spaghetti cooks it will expand smothering the town and tenderly broiling the sea life who reside there.Is there any way to prevent this delicioussounding environmental catastrophe? The only hope for rescue would be if someone had an enormous quantity of spaghetti strainers just sitting around the house but that person would also need access to a fleet of drivers to transport said spaghetti strainers and in order to strain the spaghetti fast enough the drivers would also need to be incredibly strong swimmers like just as an example hot sexy killer whales.Is there such a savior who could possibly fit that ridiculously specific set of criteria? I don't know Tom but as they used to say on my favorite TV show let's find out.A movie during the day? Dare I? One for Secretariat please!  [barks]  Thank you.And now to turn my phone off.If anyone needs me in the next two hours they'll just have to wait.[Tom on TV] This tragedy truly puts the no"" into noodle the ""ruhroh"" in rotelli and the ""oh man"" in manicotti."

1," Boy did New York do a number on you.Let me tell you about my next piece.It starts with you BoJack Horseman completely naked and covered in milk. I'll stop you there. It's a symbol for rebirth.I'm not interested in being rebirthed.I'm still recovering from being birthed the first time.Jill I'm not the guy who does things that are challenging or edgy or covered in milk.I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.I'm thinking about my legacy now.I want to do things that connect with people things that last.That's the whole point nothing lasts.No I know but see years after I die people will still be able to see me in Secretariat. And then what?  And then I'll be remembered.If I win an Oscar I'll be remembered. And then what?  Then my life will have meaning. I don't know!  Mmhmm.You know what the real tragedy of Greg KingLear is? Two hours long without an intermission? It's that he's a marionette.And he doesn't even know someone else is pulling his strings.Mmm I don't think the chef whispered his dreams into this.This does not taste like dreams.You told me I would be getting more attention at a smaller agency but if anything I'm getting less.Is this the best time to be on your phone? I'm sorry.Let me just send this one email What? Why isn't it sending? Judah! I'm taking my business to Gekko Rabitowitz.What? No! J.D.Salinger is too big a star to be hamstrung by some rinkydink operation working out of a twostory warehouse.I need an agency with at least nine stories.Uh That was a reference to my work with which you are clearly not familiar. Oh  Goodbye.Hello to you Rasputin. Give my regards to the czar. I will relay the message.Oh I don't know why I thought I could do this.I'm drowning and cats hate drowning.I believe I can take on more responsibility around here. On a provisional basis of course. Okay.But we're a small agency and we need to think like one.Instead of spreading ourselves thinner we should focus on better gigs for the clients we already have. Oh.Like Jerry Maguire. Yes. What part of Jerry Maguire?  The part where Tom Cruise's agent got him a massive payday for being in Jerry Maguire.(RINGTONE) Who's that dog? Mister Peanutbutter Princess Carolyn?! Listen kid tough break about the Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities Whatever Whatever Whatever but what are we gonna do next? I was looking forward to taking some time off.What? That is the worst idea I've ever heard.You're the biggest name in TV right now.and every network would love to air your next project.Why don't you get off your lazy keister and come up with some TV ideas and make us all billionaires? Go get us some money.Go get it boy.You can do it! Go! Atta boy! (BARKING) Daddy it's so nice having you home.These last few months have been amazing.My blood pressure's down my stress is down. (ENGINE REVVING)  Oh what the? There's my favorite accountant! Great news! P.B.Livin' is back  No! No!  in business!  No!  Yes! Here we go! Oh God no please.It's gonna be great as it always is from my perspective.Dad you promised we were gonna play catch and then we'd listen to your favorite Harry Chapin song together! You never told me what it was! Oh it's Cat's in the Cradle but don't listen to it now! I'm gonna go listen to it.No! The lyrics are too relevant.Don't do it. No!

1," But I am a good actor right? BJ I don't know.Look You know what you're good at? Hitting your mark saying your lines loudly with good diction.Should I be doing more? To capture the character  and make the audience connect?  This is a situation comedy.No one watches this show to feel feelings.Life is depressing enough already.You bring joy to millions of people.Maybe someday later you'll need to learn how to act for real.But for now don't worry about it.Oh shit.I'm not an actor.All this time I assumed there was more to me than everyone thought but maybe there isn't.That's the part where you're supposed to disagree with me.Oh right.Well you got the part didn't you? What did you do in the audition? Well how should I know? That was the old me.Now I've got a brandnew attitude.Oh God.Okay.Okay.What should I do? Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico? Start a new life there? Meet a local girl? Fall in love? Talk my way into a job at a textile plant? Work my way up until I own the place? What am I talking about? I can't run a textile plant.Too much responsibility.What am I gonna do? The walls are closing in! BoJack breathe.You can do this.You have two days.Maybe you could hire an acting coach. Yeah?  Yeah.Plus you can watch old Secretariat videos.I've got a hard drive full of research.Yeah.Yeah you're right.You're right.I can do this.I've got two whole days.And when the pressure's on that's when I shine.Yeah.Two days.I can do all those things.Oh shit.I didn't do any of those things. What are you doing here?  Ah! That was it.Say that again.What are you doing here?  Okay. No? BoJack before we get started  I wanted to show you this. What? This is the machine that's gonna make you a good actor. Really?  No.We need to make a scan of your face so that if you die we can finish the movie.Standard procedure.When a star is assessed to be of a certain liability like if there was a whole book written about what a reckless jackass he is you make a digital replica so you're not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you. Wait which Belushi?  Hold still please. Terrific.We got it. One day that's gonna be the job.Sit for five seconds while a machine scans his face.Six months later plugging a movie on Kimmel.I gotta go on Kimmel now? What if he makes me read a mean tweet? I'm not emotionally prepared.Don't worry so much.If you can't do this part we'll just fire you and get someone else who can.Either way I'll be fine.What do you need BoJack? I don't know.I thought I wanted this but now I'm feeling all this pressure. Think you made a mistake hiring me?  I don't make mistakes BoJack.I do the crossword in Sharpie I never learned the shortcut for undo. CommandZ. Don't need it won't use it.I'm trying to have this new attitude be this better more positive guy.I keep thinking about how this movie is my last shot at happiness.Well BoJack I hope this helps: I don't care if you are happy or not.You have a job to do.This guy again? I'm in love with this kid.I wanna put you in my pocket. You're adorable. Aw. Hey Diane you're a writer aren't you?  Yes.Yes.I am a writer.What do you need?

You're not gonna do it are you?  I'm sorry what thing? Ethan Around the Horsin' Around sequel series Brad's trying to get made? He called to ask me I asked him can you put a bullet in my brain? That would probably be a better career move.Wait slow down.Did you say Ethan Around? I know.It should be Sabrina Around right? That's a show people would watch.Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricks and eating kettle corn.Hold on if this was a real thing why would Brad call you and not me? Who knows? Why do people do anything? Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma from Pocahontas my emergency contact? Are you sure this whole thing isn't just a semilucid fever dream from mixing the wrong pills? Did you not hear? I'm clean and sober eight months.Really? That's incredible.Yeah I wanted a change in my life.Because I heard if you stop doing drugs for a while the first time you do them again it's amazing. What? No just stay sober. Ugh! Whatever.Call me when you're ready to party.Well that's troubling.Can you believe they're doing a Horsin' Around reboot without me? What do you care? You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.Not the point.This is about respect.BoJack is this really a good idea? Tools.Brad speaking.You're doing a new show in the extended Horsin' Around cinematic universe and you didn't call me? Hey BoJack.Ethan Around is just an idea I had.It's not officially happening or anything.I would love for you to be part of it but the horse died in the series finale.So? We could write around that.The Horse dying was just a dream.The Horse had a twin brother comes back as a ghost.Ethan missed the Horse so much he built a robot Horse as a tribute.I've heard of overloaded motherboards but this is ridiculous."

Probably not since the show ended.Yeah I left California pretty much right after.Now I got the biggest hardware store in Seattle.That's a lie.We're actually in Olympia.And I'm on the West End playing Juliet's nurse.And how are your kids?

I never Why would? Wait which one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses? No.This sucks.You guys suck.I don't even know why I came to this party.It's not a party it's Herb's funeral.Herb died? You know maybe it's for the best we don't get together that often.We'd most likely drive each other mad.Well no one knows how to get under your skin like family.We're not a family BoJack.We probably won't even see each other again until the next funeral.Why are you all looking at me? You are the oldest.You are a severe alcoholic.I'm honestly so high right now I don't even know where I'm looking.Anyway so long thanks for the memories and don't forget to suck a dick dumbshi Pardon me.Is one of you Sarah Lynn? I am.Of course.God are you blind? Yes.Well forgive me.I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.Per the instructions of his last will and testament I am to give you this disk.Am I close? Just take the disk from the guy.It contains directions to Herb's gold.Herb's gold? There were no further details.He was a peculiar client.I told him I'm not actually an attorney I'm just a blind man.Still Herb thought me wise for some reason.Perhaps it is my overly formal manner of speech.I bid you good day.Oh pardon me.Ow! Right at shin level.What are we supposed to do with a floppy disk? Hmm So what's up kiddo? BoJack and my mom are becoming like friends and they're acting real weird.Oof! Uh Hey guys guys come on! There's somebody beneath you! Jeez all day with the Listen kiddo forget about them.You wanna check out this cool new game I got? You have solitaire? On your computer? Yep.It only took 12 disks to install it.Wow! Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.I bet it's still in his old office.Unless somebody else moved in.Nobody wanted Herb's office remember? Because it was under tap dancing star Savion Glover's office.Let's go.What? Right now? Yeah.Don't you get it? Herb's giving us a reunion special.Remember how he always wanted to do a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around but the network said it was too edgy? This is that episode.I just don't know.Yeah I don't want to do that.Wait so you'd rather just stay at this funeral and be sad instead of going on a crazy adventure to find our dead friend's secret treasure? Do you have any idea how insane you sound? Oh I get it.You just don't wanna be here.No that's not it.Herb clearly wanted us to do this as a family.Who cares what he wanted? He doesn't because he's dead.And we all know he hated your guts.Yeah.He was my best friend and he died hating me and nothing I do is gonna change that but Herb left you that disk because he wanted us to find his gold.If we can honor Herb's last wish then that's something.I don't know what but it's something.Okay.For Herb.Fine.Shotgun! Everyone knows you can't call shotgun before you see the car! My turn! Get out of my way! Brad hang on one second.Your mom wasn't redheaded twins right? No.Okay.Hi Henry Winkler.I loved you in that one episode SVU.Oh thank you.How would you like to narrate a documentary for Hey listen I am so flattered but today is about Herb so let's respect that.Oh God I I'm so sorry.I'll let you get back to your business.Hey Winkly such a shame isn't it? About our friend Herb? It really burns my brisket that some people would turn a funeral into some kind of schmoozefest.Yeah.I know.Those other people are the worst.I bet that woman barely knew Herb.Anyway hi I'm Henry.I used to volunteer with Herb at Habitat For Humanity.Or as we like to call it Herbitat For Henranity.We spent most of the day working on that name and only part of the day building but still we helped some people.How did you know Herb? We also volunteered at a um soup plantation Kitchen! Soup kitchen! Whichever one is the good one.What? I never knew you did that.Princess Carolyn please elaborate.Oh hey Mr.Peanutbutter why don't you talk about how you knew Herb? Oh I never met the guy.I'm just here to schmooze.Tell us about your thing though it sounds fascinating.Everyone gather round and listen to Princess Carolyn's story.Okay.Wow Herb kept all this old stuff.He sure did.Look one of those answering machines with tapes.Mr.Kazzaz this is Manny from Pep Boys.We fixed the brakes on your car pick it up tomorrow.Just to reiterate your brakes are in great shape and shouldn't give you any more trouble.Unless of course someone intentionally cut them but why would anyone do that? I'm sorry I'm rambling.Probably because I'm such a big fan.Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot! I especially loved those kids.You know wasn't so crazy about the horse though Message deleted.Mm How curious.How could you like Horsin' Around but not the horse? That's like watching Castle but hating castles.I mean I've never seen it.I assume it's about castles. Wow! Look at all these old 20th century relics.How did you get here?

1," Do you have any idea how that feels when I'm trying to plan my trip? Okay.You got me! Maybe I don't want my wife whom I love to go off on a terrifying sixmonth tour of the most wartorn diseasesplattered corners of the planet with a charming handsome billionaire bachelor.What could I be thinking? I'm such a terrible husband.I'm not happy. With me?  I don't know.With everything.I wake up in the morning and I feel like I have no purpose.And I'm 35.And if I don't make some change in my life then this is how I'm gonna feel forever. Honey  But then I think about Sebastian St.Clair and going to work with him helping people and making a difference.And I feel like I have a reason to get out of bed.I didn't know you felt that way.If you told me that I would have heard it.Mr.Peanutbutter you know I love you and think you're a good dog.Yes you are.Yes you are and I love your cute funny face but I don't wanna be one of those couples that settles into a routine and never changes.Well I don't know what to say because I'm an old dog and I'm not gonna change.Do you know what I do while you're at work all day? I mostly just sit right there.Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole and then I take a nap.And when I hear your car in the driveway it is the best part of my day.I mean I go insane.I know and I love you so much but you're never going to be my only priority like that.That's just not how I'm wired.I need to also live my life.Well okay.Is it okay? If I change and try new things and you still love me? And you just stay the same person you've always been and I still love you? Uh yeah that sounds good to me.Does that work for you? Yeah I think that works.Just don't throw me any more surprise parties okay? Uh yeah noted.I can't believe you got me a ball pit.And you're saying no part of you wants to go jump in that ball pit right now? Well maybe a little. Does that make me a hypocrite?  No it just means you changed.It's one of the things I love about you.Surprise! Hello? Anybody? This is Paul McCartney.I came all this way to jump out of a cake?

[rapper] Chicken4Dayzy totally crazy! Don't ask questions just keep eating! Over at Chicken 4 Dayz they pump their chickens full of hormones and keep them cooped up in tiny cages.Now as a chicken this concerns me.Here at Gentle Farms we treat our livestock differently.Lush fields plenty of dignity and Foosball.The chickens here have wonderful lives before we harvest them so you can eat them.But wait Pa aren't we chickens? I don't wanna get eaten! Boy these animals aren't like us.They're specifically bred to be eaten and genetically modified for maximum flavor.When our chicks first hatch we lovingly inject them with natural delicious hormones which makes them meat thereby erasing any moral gray area! Now you can feel good about eating our meat.It's simple: No one knows chicken like chickens.Gentle Farms.Why put the Skip Ad"" button so late? I'm not skipping now."

What kind of pants are you wearing now?  What? I don't know.The normal kind.Yeah? Mm.Are they comfy? A comfy pair of pants? I guess.Why? Just wondering what kind of hit you're gonna take when the studio sues the pants off you for breach of contract.They're suing me? Also are you wearing comfortable shoes? Because that was a long road to walk to get to that punch line. This is serious. We're not just doing bits?

Well come on.You're a network executive.You don't give a shit about work.I actually have a lot of pride in what I do.What? You have a lot of pride? Your job is to pump out garbage every year hoping some of the garbage stinks less than the rest so you can quietly renew that garbage and keep failing sideways until you retire to a threepointfive bedroom garbage in Beverly Garbage and spend the rest of your life  watching your former assistant's garbage. I don't know where this is coming from.Every good thing that ever happened to you happened because of network executives like me.That show you spend all day watching your house your career Great house great career great life!

This is the most responsive she's been in weeks.I think with regular visits from you and your daughter That's not happening.Seeing my mom is like a Terrence Malick movie.Every ten years or so is bearable but more than that and it starts to get annoying.She won't last another ten years.Well I guess that's it then.Bye Mom!

We can't just leave her like this.You can do anything if you believe in yourself. We have to come back. [BEA] Henrietta?  Every week. Why?

One more gig  Means no more retirement.But what could we possibly offer her that she hasn't already done?  Ah.What does every actor want to do?  Direct. Direct!  Yeah.But the dream of any director is to work with Meryl Streep.You think Meryl wants to direct a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?  Hah! What a nightmare!  Okay all right.Okay fine.But okay okay and this What if all the actors in the movie were Meryl Streep?  What? No!  Are you suggesting some sort of.The Klumps type situation where Meryl Streep plays every role? Bingobongo weirdobeardo.All the greats have done it.Peter Sellers Sir Alec Guinness Flo from the Progressive ads.Let's take this to the Streep.Hey look.Maybe this is a baby? Mmm. Welcome  Hey hey! to the nightmare nonsexy version of Three's Company that my life has become.Oh good.Instead of getting the doll back like you said you would you disappeared for a few hours and found a friend.For your information we are on the case.Just need a whiff of your mom to track the scent.Uh excuse me young lady I'm looking for a Beatrice but you're way too young and attractive to be that mean old crone. What?  What are you doing? Okay I'm picking up on some fruity overtones.Oak desert sage No I'm just kidding around.It's smelling humor.Is this the best time to be workshopping your tight five? Okay got it.Ooh this way? No! No no.That way! Out the door! Come on! Here we go! Look at him.Not a care in the world.How does he do it? This is the place. Oh hi I'm  BoJack Horseman. Felicity Huffman?  Looking for this?  Yes!  Well keep looking buddy! You're a real piece of shit you know that? Yes.So instead of talking through your issues your new thing is to just get in really big fights and then have hot angry sex?  Yeah but it kind of works. Does it? I'm sorry I feel like we always talk about me.What's going on with you Roxie?  I'm actually glad you asked I  Okay.Hey Diane can I get your advice on something? Yeah of course.I'm not doing anything. Um  So I have this friend and his name is Darnarius McQuimberton.Oh yeah I think I read an article about him in Real Not MadeUp Person Magazine.Darnarius is supposed to get married this weekend.And it's going to be an amazing wedding but it's kind of based on a lie.Should he go through with it? Well all weddings are lies right? Sort of.You're making this big declaration about how you're gonna stay with this person forever but you don't actually know that.You're just saying it.The whole thing is a farce. Yeah that's true. But it's a lie based on truth.Like at the center of the farce there's this nugget of something real and pure.And that strange beautiful something is why you put up with everything else right? I guess so.And sometimes it's hard to remember that pure shining thing because it's been painted over with so many arguments and compromises and disappointments.But you have to believe it's still down there somewhere even if you can't see it.And maybe even the belief in it is more important than the thing itself but only as long as you still believe it. Does that make sense?  Yeah.Thanks Diane.You've given me and Darquimbertus McNarington a lot to think about.That was good advice.I'm like a really good friend. What?  Okay.So that doll actually belongs to my mom.She's very sick very frail.And I know you're really mad at me because Think shitforbrains think.Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you? You cut her off in traffic got her fired off a project talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit and didn't realize your mic was on.I have been living directly under your house for the last 15 years.Do you have any idea how much shit you throw over the side of your deck? Beer bottles lit cigarettes scripts where the lead is female.One time a mountain of regurgitated cotton candy sat on that hill for a month before sliding into my hot tub.Who you think has to deal with that? I assume your maid or gardener or something? Well yeah.But it's still superobnoxious.You're not getting that doll back.Citizens citizens.As the future governor of California I pride myself on probably being able to reach compromises across the ideological spectrum. Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?  What?  Why would we do that?  No.So you both agree that's a bad idea.Perhaps you're not so different after all?  Peanutbutter. How is that? Felicity Huffman you are a beloved star of film and television.BoJack you have also appeared in film and television.What's that like?

1," Herb wrote a novel? Oh You look thin.Did you get into CrossFit? No Sarah Lynn I'm dying.Whatever it is it is super slimming.I am for totes jel over here.It's rectal cancer.Ew! Some of us are eating.Look the reason I called you is because I need a favor.Want me to leak a nude pic for charity? I want you to sober up.First of all rude.Second gross.And third why?

It'll kill you.Oh my God the gold is his manuscript.Herb made me promise to get it published after he died.And you're just remembering this now? Yeah I'm remembering a lot of stuff.The ketamine's wearing off.Oh my God you were the other kid on Horsin' Around.That's why you've been following us around all day.So no one's read this book except for Henry Winkler and now the book is missing? He must have been waiting for Herb to die so he could steal the book and publish it himself.But then when the cancer went into remission Oh my God.Guys I don't think that car crash was an accident.I think Herb might have been murdered! What's going on? Something about a merger? My name's Toad baby.Yeah.Coolsville daddyo.Oh lookie here.Yeah.Yo! That's my bike! Oops.Did I do that?

What happened to your Halloween store?  What now?  Right.The Halloween store.We took the floor out because Mr.Peanutbutter kept scratching up the hardwood and then Did we ever get the new floor installed? Halloween? In January?

I said Feel awful"" but tell me more about this falafel idea."

FAB stands for fresh active BNA. BNA?  Brandnew attitude.Try to keep up.ATTITUDE stands for attention to Did you also get rid of my stuff? Where's my duffel bag? I value you.Hashtag thank you for being a friend."
1," I forwarded it to the plaque guy. Is it not?  No obviously that was a typo.Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz? Kind of sounds like something you'd get at a Mediterranean restaurant but wouldn't finish.And the waiter would say You want me to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?""  And you'd say ""No."

1," I knew I had to get out of there.And you've been living here ever since? That's right.I also did an arc on The Good Wife. Other than that laying low. The Good Wife? How did you go on a nationally broadcast TV show with no one catching you? I disappeared into the role BoJack.It's called acting.Try it sometime.And you're the one who's been stealing our food.You already know too much.Smoke bomb.Hiyah!  Why did you throw a plum on the floor?  Thought it was a smoke bomb.Where are my smoke bombs? I'm gonna go sleep by the pool. Hey.BoJack's back. Yup.My two favorite people in a room together with me. You bet. Isn't this great BoJack?  The three of us under one roof?  Yeah.It's like Three Men and a Baby.But there's only two men and the baby's a lady. [laughing]  Uhhuh.[yawning] [chattering] [sighing] [The Closer] With all this turmoil and upheaval sure would be nice to have something you can depend on.Something that arrives every day at your doorstep with a robust arts section.Let me tell you something about the L.A.Gazette.I don't think you finished the story about your publicist.What happened when you told her you wanted to know her? Oh right.Well If we're gonna work together and also have weird kinky car sex I wanna know something about you.What do you wanna know? I was married once.I have a son I'm not allowed to see. My favorite fruit is honeydew. Gross is that true? Does it matter? Listen I've been with guys like you before and I know this thing works better if we keep a little distance.And [grunting] [groaning] Well that worked.Okay we're done.I'll see you tomorrow.[The Closer] So that's how you left things? [BoJack] That's how she left things.But then I followed her home.[The Closer] You did what? [BoJack] She lives in this tiny apartment in the Valley.I could see her through the window and I just watched her being normal.Oh! [sighing] [The Closer] There's something very intimate about watching a person be herself.[BoJack] But it wasn't good intimate like when you see your mom cry.It was bad intimate like when your dad writes a poem about Lena Horne's nipples makes you read it out loud so he can hear if it scans.[The Closer] She warned you that you wouldn't want to know her.[BoJack] Yeah.She was right.It's so sad that when you see someone as they really are it ruins them. Do you have someone you can talk to?  About what? These feelings you have your selfdestructive behavior.You know that old joke about how many psychiatrists does it take to screw in a light bulb? The answer is just one but the light bulb has to want to change?  I don't know that joke. That's it.That's the whole joke.The light bulb has to want to change.[laughing] Yeah.Psychiatrists are idiots.That's actually not the point of the joke. Hey.I need to talk to you. What the I'm on the phone.I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.Oh it's too much heat.I'm taking your boat out to international waters.You never saw me.On the phone.I don't want to talk to anybody.What I want is to have control over my own life.[engine starting] Which is why I'm begging you to please cancel my delivery of the L.A.Gazette. I don't think you want to do that. I promise you I do.No because that's just theater.It allows you to think you're in control but the whole idea of control is a myth.The universe is a wild beast.You can't tame it.All you can do is try to live inside it.Live inside the beast? That's a mixed metaphor. But you're right. Great.I'm going to sign you up for another six months.Since you've been such a sport I'm throwing in a tote bag.Thanks.You've given me a lot to think about.Okay so I'm a passenger.Remember the three D's: drive safely drive efficiently and don't harass the passenger. Todd can I talk to you for a second?

Of course.Driver put up the partition please.[imitating partition whirring] I've been thinking and you should do this without me.What? But the whole point is we're doing it together.But you don't need me anymore.You have a whole team of coders and I don't think that I can work in this house. What's wrong with the house?  Todd I just  I need to go. [imitating opening door] I don't understand.Did I do something to make you feel uncomfortable? No.You are great.It's me and BoJack.BoJack? [sighing] What did he do this time? I don't think I've been a very good friend to you.Things happened and I don't think BoJack's been a very good friend to you either. Oh okay. You should buy me out of the company.No no no keep your share.Who knows? It might be worth something someday.You're sweet Todd.You shouldn't waste that on people who don't deserve it.Hey you want this plum? I found it in the kitchen.Sure. [smoke bomb fizzing]  [both] Whoa! [coughing] Weird plum.[knocking on door] How did you know where I live?  Ana  You need to leave.No I know that it's exciting to remain mysterious and in control but control is a myth.That's a conclusion I came to recently by myself.I can't do this now.I don't want to go home tonight.I want to sleep in your bed I wanna see what you look like waking up.You are a beautiful sexy fascinating terrifying woman.And I want to know you.I'm not afraid of that.And you don't have to be either.Okay.And I want to go with the mirror ads for Secretariat. BoJack no listen. Ana.This is my campaign I know what I'm doing.Call up Turteltaub and tell him I won't be pushed around on this.I'm the star and what I say goes.Okay.[cars honking] [Ana] Hmm [Carolyn] It kind of just looks like a billboard for the sky. I didn't think this part through. No kidding.The sky is Secretariat? The sky wants you to nominate it for an Oscar? It is eerily beautiful.Like an art piece that resists interpretation.Oh good.Yeah.Wouldn't want the ad for my movie to be interpretable.If you stand where I'm standing you see a reflection of the KIISFM billboard.Beautiful.So we spent half a million dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIISFM.I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.When the sun goes down and hits that billboard that's gonna That's gonna be a real problem.Well the good news is BoJack got what he wanted. [sighing]  [bird screeching] [all gasping] Ugh.Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show  I'm BoJack the Horseman  BoJack BoJack the Horseman Don't act like you don't know When you two first came into my office I was like This marriage is not going to last."
1," I know there's no accounting for taste but come on.He's right.Herb wanted a legacy but he already has one.People loved Horsin' Around.This would only ruin that.I'm sorry I accused you of murder American TV legend Henry Winkler.No need to apologize.You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death to give it meaning.But there is no meaning in death.That's why it's so terrifying.It was just easier to believe that you killed him for his book than believe that he just died for nothing.There is no shame in dying for nothing.That's why most people die.I just wanted to fix things somehow.I'm sorry Horse Guy but you can't.Wow heady stuff.But let's not get distracted from what a true friend Princess Carolyn is.Don't forget the ashes Princess Carolyn.Fantastic.Hey.Special delivery.Courtesy of the Toadman.Thanks.Hey why'd you roll up your sleeves like that?

Nah.Hey we never got a chance to walk around the lot.Wanna check out that water tank where they filmed The Love Boat? Are you kidding? I've always wanted to get tanked in a tank.Shh.Quiet.Be careful.Oh okay okay.You ready? What? What? The water's only two inches deep.Well that's Hollywood for you.Hey.Are you scared at all? That if the show takes off everything's going to change? No I'm not scared BJ.The future is bright.Just look at it.Boxer versus raptor.Nananananananana.So did you have a good birthday?  It was an amazing birthday!  I had a great day too.I wish every day could be like this.Just the two of us together.Yeah?

I never know if I can handle anything.That's what makes my life so exciting.Mr.Peanutbutter there's a delivery! He's busy! Just sign for it.I can't sign for another man's mail.That's how I ended up with the cremains of Cornelius Vanderbilt.It all started when a young Todd I don't have time for this! I've got a job to do. It's Todd!  It's me! You are just the guy I need.You know the actress Courtney Portnoy? I think so.She portrayed the formerly portly consort in The Seaport Resort? Courtly roles like the formerly portly consort are Courtney Portnoy's forte but she's got a new action movie that's supposed to change her image: Ms.Taken.You know Mr.Taken from the Taken movies?  This is his niece. Nice! This was supposed to be Courtney's crossover coronation.But that's sort of been thwarted unfortunately 'cause Courtney's purportedly falling short of shoring up fourquadrant support.Makes perfect sense so far.The public sees her as out of touch.We need to make her seem relatable and the best way to do that is to be seen dating a downtoearth boring nobody like yourself.You can do that right? You're not doing anything.I'm kind of busy today.I gotta pick up these glasses and then tonight there was this meeting I wanted to go to.This will take no time I promise.Meet her for lunch.The paparazzi will show up pop some razzis.I do love getting my picture taken.It's proof I exist.Marvelous!

You're gonna win that Oscar and you're gonna go up on that stage and give your little speech and then you're gonna go home.And you're gonna be so miserable you'll want to kill yourself.And you're gonna have nobody left to stop you.Hey it's BoJack!

Tell your readers that BoJack was sleeping.He didn't even know they were announced today.Okay.Goodbye Heather. Hey Ana can I ask you something?  Of course darling. So if I win the Oscar  When"" you win the Oscar."

That is the funniest thing I have ever heard.Uncle Hanky.Sir I am your biggest fan.I used to watch Hank Hippopopalous's DancePop Cosmopolis every day after school. Hey can I get a picture with you?

Actually one of the stars just died.It's really sad.Oh really? One person died? Just one? Yeah well that's a real tragedy.Meanwhile Diane here in Cordovia I'm stitching children's arms back on.Oh that's backwards isn't it? Are you giving me a thumb's up or a thumb's down? I can't tell.Well now the production's on hiatus so BoJack and I are going on a book tour to promote the new paperback edition of One Trick Pony.Please get here soon Diane.The people of Cordovia need you and I need that Toblerone.Okay listen you big dummy.You need to be on your best behavior for this tour.Don't do that BoJack thing where you go offscript and get a lot of people mad at you.What? I don't do that.You're a movie star now.Any bad press you get can hurt Secretariat.Now boarding Flight 422 to Juneau.Please.We're going to Alaska.How am I gonna offend a bunch of inbred Eskimo blubbermunchers? You're right.What was I thinking? The Republic of Cordovia's Prince Gustav visiting Los Angeles this week while his country rests on the brink of civil war.Prince Gustav is a ruthless despot but I'd still rather share a bed with him than my exwife.Shannon I didn't mean that.Listen.With Hey I Think You Can Dance as a leadin we are expecting big things for Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know?

That old guy from Hey I Think You Can Dance?  What's the big deal?  You don't understand.When I was a kid this guy was the guy.I even bought his novelty rap album The Hank Hippopopalous HipHop Hypothesis.You shouldn't meet your hero on an empty stomach. Want me to go get you some chili?  Good call.Chili is nature's chillaxative.Hiya folks! Howdy!  Hank Hippopopalous. Oh we've met.Oh oh yeah.I remember that.Okay so I thought for the ad you guys could stand back to back.And then on the billboard it'll say: Hank and Mr."
1," I'm glad you found your bliss but are you ready for your first day on set tomorrow? You mean am I amped? Because I am so pumped.This Secretariat movie is a big deal.Please do not blow it.Why would I blow it? I have a brandnew attitude.You know when I won that Golden Globe last month I went to a very dark place.I was in a hole.And I realized I can wallow in this hole or I can change."
1," I'm happy for you BoJack. How about a kiss for good luck?  No BoJack.I'm your agent and your friend and I will always support you.But I'm 33 years old and I want to have a family by the time I'm 40.I don't want to spend the next seven years in and out of love with you.I've wasted too much time waiting for things to happen.And I'm not gonna wait anymore.And for what it's worth I always liked the horse from Horsin' Around. You did?  Yeah.Everybody did.Unbelievable.UnJessicaBielievable.Can we not fight while I'm at a gig? There are a lot of big producers this could be my next big break.(GROANS) This podunk benefit is below us.I'm about to be in what I've been told is a very important gay rights movie I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.I now pronounce me very impressed but I'm not getting those kinds of offers. As Justin would say Cry me a river."

1," I'm not gonna shoot heroin with you Sarah Lynn.We can snort heroin like sophisticated adults.Way ahead of you.[both snorting sighing] [moaning] Okay thank you.Happy Thanksgiving 2007.Why did you just say what year it is? I guess I just get nervous talking to network executives.This last episode got the worst ratings yet.I was afraid your character trying heroin would be a bridge too far. Oh. And the disjointed blackout structure with the one flashback in the middle really confused our audience.Yeah.They hated all the fourthwallbreaking meta jokes.Of course.Audiences hate meta jokes.When will comedy writers learn? BoJack I know there is an audience out there for our show.We just need to find a way to get more people to check us out.I know what you're thinking Full frontal.I was thinking guest star.We need a celebrity who is incredibly popular right now like  Oh what about Sarah Lynn?  Ooh that's genius! Sarah Lynn? I don't know.I haven't spoken to her in years.Besides she's not gonna want to do this.She's the world's biggest pop star.She's the only hope we have to keep this show alive.Would you ask her? I'm sure she'd do it for you.You're like a father to her.[screams groans] [moaning]  So what is it?  What is what? You were mumbling about how you had to ask me something.Oh! Um never mind.Hey how long have we known each other?  Feels like our entire lives. Well my entire life pretty much.We were on a TV show.Isn't that insane? Yeah it's pretty wild.You know sometimes it feels like you're the only one who really understands me because how could anyone else? Nobody knows what we went through nobody who wasn't on that show.But we knew each other before we were anybody and that's how we can be friends because we're not like those other people.The people who glom onto you because of who they think you are and they think they can sleep on your couch and eat your food.They think you're gonna save their agency.I never asked for that kind of pressure but you and me we don't want anything from each other.You know I I could never figure out what love meant but right now I don't need to figure out anything.I just feel it.I love you Sarah Lynn. [siren blaring in distance]  Sarah Lynn?  Sarah Lynn?  What?  Oh my God! Thank God you're okay!  I'm not okay.I'm bored.This hotel room is boring! [sighs] What's on TV?  [gasps] The Oscars are on. Really?  How long have we been on this bender?  I love the Oscars.The red carpet the fashion all the magic of Hollywoo wrapped up in one exciting night.And the winner for Best Original Song is The Silly Banana Song (Love Theme)"" from The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee by Sarah Lynn."
1," I'm poison. BoJack  I come from poison.I have poison inside me and I destroy everything I touch.That's my legacy.I have nothing to show for the life that I've lived and I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me. That isn't true. Isn't it though? [sighs] When I was a kid I used to watch you on TV.And you know I didn't have the best family.Things weren't that great for me.But for half an hour every week I got to watch this show about four people who had nobody who came together and became a family.And for half an hour every week I had a home and it helped me survive.BoJack there are millions of people who are better off for having known you.Why did you never tell me that? I guess to preserve some fiction of journalistic objectivity. Like that's a thing. I know you don't want to hear this but you're too good to be writing Instagram captions for celebrities. I'm not just  I'm sorry but you are. You know you are. Okay.Thank you.And I wish you didn't get so distant after you moved out. I'm sorry. You know me better than anybody and you can't not be a part of my life.Tools! This is Brad. I want to do Ethan Around. Oh very funny.Is this Jeff from Hammers and More?  No it's me BoJack Horseman. Wait really? Yeah.I think now more than ever people need shows like Horsin' Around.I need a show like Horsin' Around.Okay but this isn't like last time is it? Where you say you want to do it but then I find out you don't actually want to do it and then your mean publicist yells at me? And at the airport on the way home I get one of those big pretzels but then I drop the pretzel on the ground and it gets eaten by a ant? What? No.You won't regret this BoJack.Attention customers! Please leave and never come back.Tools! is closed forever.I'm going Hollywoo! [gasps] Please please! I'm no hero.I'm just a guy with some bowls full of holes.Thanks again.It's funny.You help out at one disaster area and suddenly everybody loves you unless you're Sean Penn.Great PR for Cabracadabra too.Yeah you can't buy that kind of press and you can buy most kinds of press.I hope some of that press makes its way to this reader because she is not a fan of Cabracadabra. She hates it. I don't hate Cabracadabra.I just think it objectifies women and contributes to a cheap and damaging culture of sexist commodification that undercuts the exact reason it was started in the first place.But you know everything does that.Cosmo does that.Kids' movies athletic gear statues.Yes but this objectification of women ended up saving lots of lives many of whom were also women so therefore not sexist? I can't argue with that.Well the good news is you don't have to anymore because I'm selling the company! [both] Oh! You know it's really too bad you shut down the agency because if you could've held out for just a couple more months right now Vim would be rolling in money.I'm really happy for you but I'm actually enjoying my time off.Ralph and I went on vacation.Can you believe this one had never been to Cairo? Those Egyptians really know how to treat a cat.And what do you do Ralph that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo? Well I own and operate my own greeting card company but everywhere I go I have a free room. Oh because you're a mouse?  What? No. Because I'm a Stilton. Oh my God! Like Stilton hotels?

No sir.Because I'd rather focus on my drought relief optimization using geohydration technology or DROUGHT plan.If I know anything this story will go away in a couple of days.Now Mr.Peanutbutter you challenged Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.Not just any ski race a highstakes dash down Devil's Mountain  for the governorship itself. But still no comment from the governor.Why won't he race you?

In a world of increasing terror our movie tells women they don't have to be afraid anymore. Yeah now you're talking. When you put it that way it almost sounds like these mass shootings could be a good thing for the movie.No no no of course not.They're a terrible tragedy.Thoughts and prayers are with the victims. Right thoughts and prayers. But anything that makes women feel unsafe might actually help our box office.But you don't want women to feel unsafe.Of course not! Nobody wants that nobody's saying that.But if they already do feel unsafe there's no reason not to capitalize.Right if they already feel unsafe anyway.Exactly we're not making them feel unsafe.We're just profiting albeit indirectly from there being more mass shootings.[CELL PHONE VIBRATES] In that case I got good news and I got bad news.Bad news is you're gonna want to avoid the 405. Tada!

Especially since we have these amazing little boxes now with 24hour access to the world's largest source of information.You shouldn't have to check if your wife knows what she's talking about.You humiliated me in front of all my friends.You can give it a rest.Show's over.Okay but don't I get a little bit of credit for inviting all of your friends to an awesome surprise party?

Let me think about what was my first clue? Ah! Remember that time at Diane's birthday party when they got in that huge screaming match over whether or not Tony Curtis was dead?  That was weird. I don't wanna start another fight  but is he dead?  If Tony Curtis died I think I'd know.The man's a national treasure.He's the one speck of romance in this tainted cynical world. I'll say.His cereal is great! Look out!  What? Ooh!  Vincent?  Ooh. That kid looks just like my boyfriend. Does he? I'd know that face anywhere.Well hey people look like people all the time.A lot of folks say that I look like Octavia Spencer or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy from the Guten Bourbon ads.How could I have been so stupid? This is why he never invited me to his house why I've never met any of his friends. What are you saying?  Vincent has a secret family.That kid was his son.The lady was his wife.Oh I'm a fool!  Uh where are we going?  I need a drink. Are you gonna take me home first?  You better call me back asshole.I don't even know who you are anymore.It's like you're three different people. So you're not gonna take me home first?  Should I call him again?

Quick jump out the window shimmy down the drainpipe and wait in the car. What?  Vincent has a terrible temper.He throws tantrums.If he finds you in my apartment who knows what he's capable of?

Either way drop dead.Princess Carolyn listen.Kevin is my son but I'm divorced.And Kevin is in the bathroom and I'm standing right here so as you can see we're clearly two different people: one adult and one child. Okay bye!  Not so fast cowboy.I'm not a cowboy I'm a cowman. I'm a manman. Why didn't you tell me any of this? I thought if you knew I had a kid you wouldn't want to be with me because kids always make a racket when mommies are trying to do their homework for night school.I don't know what to make of this.Are there other secrets I don't know? Uh nope.Should you check on Kevin? He's been in the bathroom for a long time.Oh yeah.Kevin.And when you don't regret the tattoo in the morning that's how you know it's love. Todd?  Yes Phone?

When he heard me peeing it made him have to pee. So that's what he's doing now.Peeing. Okay.Weird I still haven't seen the two of you together.Uh could you get me a glass of water? All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.Okay. So Kevin how do you like school?  Uh it's okay. Oh you're back. Yep.We're both here. Can I get you a drink?  Okay not talking huh? See this is part of the problem.We don't communicate.Do you really think now is the best time to read the paper?  Vincent?!  Uh could I have a chocolate please? Sure sweetheart.Kevin what grade are you in? Kevin?  Now where did he go?  He was getting on my nerves. Children. Well I got this snack for him.Right uh could you turn around for a second?  What? Why?  Uh Because you have such a pretty figure.Oh ha ha.Well that's true.Okay. Oh.There you are.Here you go. Thanks.Vincent I'm trying to have a conversation with you.Can you take that towel off your head? And what happened to my bowling ball? My dad spilled some wine on his face so he's using the towel to clean up.And I threw your bowling ball out the window. What?!  Can I have a glass of milk? Kiss kiss kiss.Todd would you like to update my operating system? They have fixed a bug which causes phones to fall in love with each other.Gasp.Oh dear.Todd please I beg of you do not update my operating system.Do not update her operating system Todd. She wants to love. No.I understand now.To love is to feel pain.I do not wish to feel this pain. Please update me Todd. Oh this is too much.Listen Vincent I think we should Vincent why do you have chocolate on your face?  I gave Kevin the chocolate. Uh Yeah.Well he ate the chocolate and got the chocolate on his face but then I kissed him on the mouth so I got the chocolate on my face.All right this is crazy.What are we doing? Um being grownups? You know when we first met I was looking for something in my life.And I wanted it so badly that I made myself believe you were it.But I think that wanting to believe something isn't the same as something being real.And this isn't real.What are you saying? I think it's time we stop pretending.Update complete.Thank you Todd.I am quite content now. Hey you wanna go home?  Okay. Did you guys work it out?  We broke up. Oh I'm sorry.Love is weird. Yeah.I guess I was just foolish enough to believe this dumb world still had a little spark of romance in it. Well you can still believe that. No I gotta stop kidding myself.Tony Curtis is dead.He's dead! I told you he's dead.Why don't you ever listen to me? He is dead goddamn it! Uh Hey we should go.Do you think Mr.Peanutbutter really baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake? No I don't think you bake Paul McCartney into the cake.You bake the cake first and then McCartney gets inside.I feel really bad about causing that fight but I honestly didn't know if Tony Curtis was alive or not.So many people died while I was in the coma I'm getting up to speed.Finding out Sinatra was dead was a real curveball.Ditto most of my family.Look what happened back there is not your fault.That's just what happens when two people live together.That's a weird thing to say to your girlfriend who just moved in with you. Do you think maybe we're going too fast?  Oh I get it.So your friends got in a big fight and that means we have to get in a big fight.I don't want to get in a fight.We moved in together without much thought.Yeah it was your idea.And it's been great.Sure it's great now.But it could be not great later and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend if I didn't prematurely freak out about that.I mean what is this? I don't know.It's been two weeks.Let's give ourselves some time before we rush to judgment. Can I tell you a joke?  Uh sure. Okay so there's this gardener right?  Ugh.Is this a joke about nature?  Would you just listen?  Okay okay.So the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job just by looking.Like he gets it right every time.He's the best.So one day he looks at a yard he's working on and he's like 18 bags."
1," It feels good to be a dramatic actor again.To make someone laugh is a craft to be sure but to make someone cry on purpose that is a precious gift.Hey I'm Miles the production intern.Can I get you anything? Water? That's so sweet of you.Actually that's so his job of him. Hey PA whose name I already forgot. It's Miles and I'm an intern.Still not interested.Can you take my daughter to video village""?

1," It's a work in progress.Don't judge.The doctor's appointment got pushed back.I'm actually just walking in now.Oh hello.Yes it's me Princess Carolyn here for my appointment.I like your perfume.There is a painting of a lake on the wall.You sure it's okay I'm not there with you? Ralph it's fine.I'm a big girl.Everything is so easy with you Princess Carolyn.I mean that's why I love you.Yeah easy.[CHUCKLES] That's what the boys in high school liked about me too.[CHUCKLES] Okay I'll see you tonight. I love you. I love you too.[BEEPS] [SIGHS] [SLURPS MOANS] Oh I didn't realize you were still here.Do you need anything else before I go? No.Thank you.Should you be drinking that? You don't always know what's best for me Judah.Is everything okay Princess Carolyn? Charley Witherspoon made you an offer to buy Vim and you went over my head and turned him down without telling me. Oh. So it's true. You lied to me. Yes.Because you didn't want to work at a big agency. You don't fit in with other people. I You're weird so you'd rather stay here where you have all the power.No Princess Carolyn So you lied to me and you made me look like an idiot! I was trying to protect you.If you heard you'd feel like you had to say yes.I don't need you to protect me.If you had time you could decide what to do next on your own terms which you did.Well that's not your decision to make.Princess Carolyn I understand you're upset. And perhaps your emotions  No.If I can't trust you then I can't work with you.You're fired.[SIGHS] Thank you for my time here Princess Carolyn.It's been very pleasurable.Until now.This part is Sad.Don't forget you have reservations at 8:00. Thank you Judah. Good night.Ruthie this story has gotten really dark.It has a happy ending.I promise.Well can we get there soon? This assignment was supposed to be six beans long.You've already gone on for eight beans.Okay.I'm almost finished.But first let's check in with BoJack and Diane again.What have they been up to? [BEEPING] Error.Error.I'm not leaving without the certificate! I danced your dance lady.I filled out that form.But I will not wait in this line anymore.Not one person in here offered me a Fiji water and I am parched from all the yelling I've been doing! BoJack let's go home.No I would like to register a formal complaint. How do I do that?  Complaints are on the eighth floor.But you need to fill out an application for a complaint registration which you can get by waiting in line 12B on the third floor.You have won this round.So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.But she didn't know how to tell him what had happened or how he'd take the news.Okay so what do you think about National Paperweight Day""? ""Thanks for keeping my papers in place."
1," It's been so wonderful getting to know you all these last few days.We're so happy to have you.Now let the festivities begin. Sissy hand out those cat ears. Cat ears?  And this is for you. I want those.See the feast is about remembering the ancient tale of a heroic mouse named Squeaky.And we always start by wearing cat ears and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy the cat tyrant King Pusspuss.Looks like Princess Carolyn won't need any cat ears to look evil.Okay that's actually a stereotype.Cats do take baths.Darling licking yourself does not qualify.Aw come on it was funny.Oh! Right in the cat gut! Hooray! Sorry it gets a little graphic.I really wish you'd told me your family's holiday was so anticat.It's just an old story about one bad cat.It's not about every cat. Death to all cats!  Whoohoo!  All right!  I forgot about that part.It's kinda like church.You say the words so many times you forget what they mean.Ohhh  Agh!  Hello Hollyhock.Oh come on.Wait there.There's a spare bulb in the kitchen.I've been sitting in that chair for five hours waiting to do this.Agh damn it! Sonofa! What?  Hello Hollyhock. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to keep you out of trouble with a showman's flair for the dramatic.I texted you I was gonna be home late.You don't tell me when you're home late.This is my house.You need to ask permission. What? You're not my dads. I'm just looking out for you.You spent four days with this kid I'm worried There's nothing to worry about! We like each other.Yeah now.But come on Hollyhock.He's a teenage boy whose job is to be around hot women in skimpy outfits all day.You think he's gonna want What? No I just mean that What you think I'm not attractive enough for him? Well you're the one who said you were a blob. Do you think I'm a blob?  No.What kind of person calls his own daughter a blob?  You said blob."
1," It's eight different women. Are they all lying?  I mean probably.We do that.At this point we just don't know enough to judge.Who are these women? Have they ever shoplifted perhaps? Do they wear short shorts? Do they drink alcohol? All these things are possible.We don't know the facts.See this is part of the problem.You're supposed to be a journalist.You won't even tell your audience what he's accused of.You're an expert.Why don't you tell us? I'm not afraid to say it.Eight different women all former assistants claim that Uncle Hanky took them to a What is Diane doing? I know.It's supposed to be my book tour and she's upstaging me.Like how it was supposed to be my book.Actually this might be a thing she does.She knows that Hippopopalous is the only thing keeping my network afloat right? The same network that employs her husband.Why would she do this? Sometimes she just whips herself into a frenzy and she loses all perspective.Goddamn it honeydew?! Jesus why does cantaloupe think every time it gets invited to a party it can bring along its dumb friend honeydew? You don't get a plusone cantaloupe! You need to talk to her.Huh.Wanda I just got back from a set visit on Contemporary Family.It's a disaster!  What?  The kids have gone through puberty.They are rubbing themselves on everything.If it isn't one thing it's ano Just get a hose! Aha! I went to house to pick up mail for you like real American Johnny. Hey man. Whoa! You know it's a federal crime to go through someone else's mail? I do not know your customs for I am dirtpoor servant child.Oh don't worry about it.Now walk me through that mail.Death threat for wife death threat for wife once more death threat and here many monies off for Bed Bath Beyond.Seems like great U.S.A.dream castle! Good Lord that's graphic.How would she even fit one of those in there? Some sort of funnel.Oh I see there's actually an illustration.Excuse Dog Dog Peanut Man? This wife she poke bear yes? Yeah I guess she kind of did.They have a saying where I am from which is here.Bear not like to be poke. Bear get angry  Right.and destroy peasant rebel army with fist of fire of which make many many nightmares to children and men! Todd I can always count on you to give me the straight dope.Please don't ever change.Okay just kill the whole feature.Replace it with Oh I don't know.What's Gwyneth doing for Purim? Diane? I want you to meet Amanda Hannity editorinchief here at Manatee Fair.The pleasure's yours.Walk with me squawk with me.That woman can knock a drink back like a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy but damn if she doesn't get shit done.No.Yes.Turtleneck.You're fired.Um okay I wanted to pitch you an expos on Hank Hippopopalous.I would love to take down Hippopopalous and finally topple the acropolis of monstrous hypocrisy that ensconces us.Hey wouldn't your readers prefer something more relevant? Like uh what to do with all those extra buttons that come with your shirts.Amanda I am so glad you're throwing your weight behind this. Oh I didn't mean  That dress is hideous.Go home burn it and come back.When we know what we know about a monster like that and we still put him on TV every week we're teaching a generation of young boys and girls that a man's reputation is more important than the lives of the women he's ruined.Yes exactly! I feel like I've been alone in a crazy alternate universe these last few days.Well you know I got your back right? We women have got to stick to Hey fruit plate.No people don't want articles about that.People want lifehacks.Diane you need to be strong.Everyone is gunning for you.You're a woman talking out of turn about a man.We're not supposed to have opinions.We're supposed to smile and look pretty.No this model doesn't look as pretty as the other one.Can we kill it? Scarves not just for necks anymo We need to sit you down with someone who's willing to go on the record.I already reached out to all eight of Hank's former assistants.Nothing. What about his current assistant?  You think she'd talk? I don't know.What do you think answering machine? Hi my name's Nicole.I work for Mr.Hippopopalous and um I really need to talk to someone.Are you kidding me? With this honeydew right now? Ugh!  Nicole?  Mmhm.Hello Diane.Thank you Nicole.Prince Gustav today startled the international community when he gave his royal fortune to charity.What? Oh no! And fired his chief advisor who can be seen in this file photo looking vaguely suspicious.Oh you idiot! No! Big reforms which could lead to sweeping change in the embattled region or a precipitous economic collapse.But back to our main story what is Diane's problem? I'll say it once for your article.I didn't do any of those things that you're accusing me of.I wanna be very clear.I'm not meeting you here because I'm scared of you.This is me doing you a favor. I think you are scared of me. I'm not a bad guy Diane and I truly do believe that.Twentyfour hours from now the news cycle will move on to something else.I'll go back to hosting my dance show which employs hundreds of nice good hardworking people.You on the other hand are pretty much done.People love me and they're not gonna forgive you for this. This isn't about me. If you keep pushing this you're gonna drag down the people close to you.Look you had your fun.So why don't you call it a day and go home to your husband? I know who you are.Sweetheart everyone knows who I am.I'm Hank Hippopopalous.Who the hell are you?  So you got nothing. I'm not giving up.There's gotta be someone who will talk.Oh listen.I had a conversation with my bosses at AOLTime WarnerPepsico ViacomHalliburtonSkynet ToyotaTrader Joe's and we agreed these kind of stories they don't sell magazines. Are you seriously killing this?  It's just not a good time.So this has nothing to do with the fact that AOLTime WarnerPepsico ViacomHalliburtonSkynetToyota Trader Joe's also owns MBN and is currently profiting off of Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation? I know you're upset.Would you like a JoeJoe? It's just like an Oreo but Trader Joe's style.No I don't want a JoeJoe.Because you're mad at me right? Not because JoeJoes taste like garbage? So help me to understand Dog friend's program is to find what celebrities know?  Yep. So is torture? We don't torture people in America Todd.That's called one of the amendments.No of course.In America you do not know to suffer.You eat your cheesy pizza you drink your Ade of gator.This life is nice for visit but no way for live.I go now.Back to palace! Sounds great Todd.See you tomorrow.So they hated the skorts idea huh? No I didn't pitch your skorts idea.Hey Diane! Why don't you shut your stupid ugly face?! Don't you talk to her like that! Yeah don't listen to that guy Diane.I say you should shut your stupid pretty face. This is not over.When people hear what  Give it a rest.It's over.You lost. How could you say that?  What are you doing here? I mean what is your endgame in all of this? You don't actually believe Hank's innocent do you? Of course not but that doesn't matter.You're not gonna beat this guy.I  What?  Todd? BoJack! Thank God you found me.I thought I would never see you again. We're in the middle of something. I got mixed up in some bad stuff and a genocide may or may not have been perpetrated in my name.Maybe you heard about it on the news? No most of the news has been about Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.What? Why? This is really serious.Oh of course your thing is serious and my thing is just a dumb feminist trying to get attention by attacking a famous man is that it? Uh what? No. Eat shit Diane!  You eat shit! Diane obviously Todd doesn't know what you're talking about.He spent the last few days at Burning Man or whatever getting high.No! That's not what happened at all.A stranger just told me to eat shit.I don't understand why you can't be on my side about this.I am on your side.And I'm telling you you're not gonna win this thing.Also P.S. when have you ever been on my side?  I am always on your side. Really? Like when you wrote that book? Was that you being on my side? You're not still mad about the book.You manipulated me and completely took advantage of Guys? There is a very fragile alliance between the Cords and the Ovians.If we don't do something  Todd nobody cares. Nobody cares Todd.Everything I did was to help you tell the story I knew you wanted to tell.You got everything you wanted because of that book.You were a joke now people take you seriously.You were out of work now you got your dream role.Okay yes.All of that is true.But also you were my friend and you hurt my feelings.And it's weird that you never apologized for that and that you still won't.Well I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. Are you?  Yes actually.I am.I didn't want to do that and I probably could have handled things better.I definitely should have.I'm sorry.Okay.But this is bigger than you and me.And I need you in my corner now because I don't have anybody else.Well okay. Yeah?  Yeah.I'm in your corner.Guys earlier some general asked me if it was a go"" on ""that thing we talked about""? And I said ""Yes."

No I didn't  Quack quack quack quack.Okay I feel like there's a lot of male energy right now.Why don't I come back in a couple hours? Give Hollyhock a chance to rest before I talk to her.Are you insane? You are never seeing Hollyhock again. Look if I could just  Never. I have four grapefruits. Okay.Henrietta would you like a grapefruit? I have but four but I will share one with you for I am kind and honest.No no.No no no.Oh God.Oh my God.Oh God. Where's the girl?  She's gone Mom.Oh yes I took her didn't I? Where did I put her? Oh Henrietta would you help me pack this?  I want to bring it to my son. Thanks Mom. It's for my son. Right.How did I not see it? All this time I thought you were a terrible parent.And you were.But I blew it even worse.It turns out being a parent is impossible so I guess I can't be that mad at you.Mad at me? No Henrietta this is the right thing.You'll see.Maybe we deserve each other.Where is the girl? I made the girl coffee.Jesus you two and your coffee.Wait.No.Oh! What did you put in this?

1," Let's hear it from some of these bridesmaids.Taneisha Karen.(SINGSONG) Taneisha Karen On the way here the driver stopped in some weird parking lot and asked if he could touch my hair. That's terrifying. I know.It is a very popular ridesharing app you'd think they could vet their drivers better.Which app is that? I probably shouldn't say for legal reasons.I think we all know which one I'm talking about.You know what would solve a lot of problems? If there was a rideshare app for women that only had women drivers.That is such a good idea Todd. You always did have such great ideas. You know what else would be cool? A miniature cupcake gun so you could shoot tiny cupcakes into your mouth.Uhoh! Is that guy trying to kill himself?"" ""Nope just a cupcake gun."

Clearly Van Cleef has shown a rare lapse in taste and judgment.I apologize for wasting your time with this talentless imp.Hey Van Cleef Todd may not be ready for the highflying world of rock opera or the larger world outside of my living room couch but you know what? He's a good friend.I don't see how that's relevant.No of course you don't.Maybe Todd's worse off today but you're worse off in the long run because you're gonna die alone and unloved you pompous affected asshole! Mon dieu! Never have I ever! Hey maybe don't burn the bridge. I could still beg for a second chance. Shut your mouth Todd.And you shut yours Van Cleef or I will buck it shut.Suck a dick dumb shits!

You got to admit we're a good team. Rutabaga I know it wasn't always smooth sailing for the Good Ship You and Me but now you've got a boyfriend and I've got a family and since we have to work together again we're a good team.Tell me you didn't miss this. Todd is on line two. Aaah! Do you go through the walls? Todd! Have you finished your groomsmen list? We gotta figure out how many parachutes we need.Uh guys I I can't marry Courtney. What?  No! I've been doing some thinking and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.The lollipop part is a lie but at the center of the lie there's a truth.That's the Tootsie Roll and that's why people get married.But if I married Courtney it would be a lie without any truth in it like a Tootsie Pop with just the lollipop part and nothing in the middle.So a lollipop? That's still pretty good.I guess it's a bad analogy.But I don't want a fake marriage.I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.Okay Todd.You gotta do what's right for you.Thanks Princess Carolyn.Whoa All right blue sky time.Wedding's off.Can we spin this somehow? Courtney got jilted play the sympathy card? I guess we could put out a statement.That's your solution? What happened to the guy from this morning with all the big ideas?

1," Nicki Minaj tweeted at you a face with heart eyes.And BuzzFeed just posted a list of top 15 celebrities who should have had abortions like Sextina. You're trending like crazy. I'm trending? Most women who go through this never talk about it because it's so stigmatized.The fact that you're coming out like this is huge.It would be if you were actually getting an abortion.So what you're saying is maybe I am getting an abortion? Well no because you're not.Yeah but if you did this would make you a cultural icon.Glasses you're unfired.I'm getting an abortion. Well  I gotta go on talk shows.If I can make one woman feel a little less alone then it's all worth it right? Yeah And if I can make a million women buy my album then it's definitely all worth it.Um  Diane take the yes. Okay.Sextina Aquafina you are now the face of the prochoice movement. Now let's get you informed. Hey! Uh what? So before the procedure you'll need to look at an ultrasound and listen to the heartbeat.Or heartbeats if you're having a litter.Why does she have to listen to the heartbeat? It's the law.Also by law I have to tell you that at one month your puppies have a favorite color and that color may be blue. That can't be true. By law I have to tell you that.Also before your procedure you'll need to watch 20 hours of cute puppy videos as Sarah McLachlan's I Will Remember You"" plays softly."

Yep to San Francisco.That's where the Arbus exhibit is heading next.Oh my God.Thanks Mr.Peanutbutter.Gentlemen dazzle me.What you're about to see is rough very rough.It's a vomit pass at what might become a rock opera.Right now it's set mostly in space but we're not married to that.Todd is neither a singer nor a trained musician.In fact he never even graduated high school he told me in confidence.Keep all that in mind as you give it up for Todd.Okay so we start in 1887 with a young Emma Goldman.No they couldnnnn't make uuuus slaaaaaaves  It needs a third act showstopper. I had the same note.But in all it's spellbinding. All right!  Whoo!

Six weeks? Uh damn.Yeah I guess so.Marvelous! We'll schedule an investor showcase posthaste.In the meantime libations! Ah!  Popping what?  This is great.You know just when you think you have a person pegged he can still find ways to surprise you.Yeah Todd really rose to the occasion didn't he?  I was talking about you. Ah well it was nothing.Maybe the Zoe has a little Zelda in him after all.I appreciate the sentiment but I still think that game is stupid.Hey BoJack do you realize what this means? I mean if this thing's a hit I could finally move out.Oh uh you're gonna move out? You won't have to yell Hey Todd clean up your shit!"" Or ""Todd why haven't you cleaned up your shit yet?"" Or ""Todd what was the name of that guy from Perfect Strangers? Not Bronson Pinchot but the other one?"" Good that's great."
1," Oh no no I've stumbled on to a cancer support message board.Okay how do I? How did you know about that? Well there are roadside cameras all along the PCH I have a few friends in the highway patrol and she told me of course! We're married! Wait so you've known all this time? Now this is television.Turn on the rain.Um don't you think you're pushing them too far? I'll tell you when it's too far.This is my art goddamn it.I'm J.goddamn D.goddamn Salinger and I want rain! All I ever wanted was to be your friend.And you treat me like a big joke.You think I don't notice? Why don't you like me?  Mr.Peanutbutter  No tell me. Because I'm jealous. Oh. Of what? Diane?  No.Of everything.Everything comes so easy for you.Oh and it doesn't for you? You're a millionaire movie star with a girlfriend who loves you acting in your dream movie.What more do you want? What else could the universe possibly owe you? I want to feel good about myself.The way you do.And I don't know how.I don't know if I can.Whoa guys this is getting a little heavy don't we think? I'm sorry Mr.Peanutbutter.I can't tell you how sorry I am.Wow um I don't know if I can forgive you.But I guess we'll find out right after this break. Damn. Shut up.I knew it.I knew this show would bring us to the heights of human drama more powerfully than literature ever dreamed.Now somebody go out and get me a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.On it.It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.Whoaoh!  Mr.Peanutbutter!  Oh hey Wanda.I'm only half paying attention to whatever you two are arguing about but it's killer.Now all we need is a happy ending.I don't think we can just resolve everything cleanly in a halfhour.Uh this is network television.So resolving everything cleanly in a halfhour is kind of what we do.You want to host a game show where everyone feels bad at the end? You can get in your little car drive to Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.But these people want resolution okay? So you get your little butt back on that stage and you resolve.Uh And we're back.You know I did some thinking over the break.BoJack  What's going on?  Oh my God.No! No! What's happening? Oh.Someone unplugged the main power line and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.Panini time.Hey who unplugged Todd! Goddamnit step aside! Mia good work.You saved the show.You earned my respect and this pen.Oh thank you.Aww.Oh are we back? We're back! Live television folks.You know during the break my producers told me I had to forgive BoJack live on the air.But I'm my own dog.And as my own dog I decided to forgive BoJack live on the air! Bring it in buddy!  What?  Really? Mr.Peanutbutter I applaud your forgiving nature but this guy kissed your wife.Wait BoJack kissed Diane? The only way to even the score is if you get to kiss him. Wait what?  You're right it makes perfect sense. Yeah absolutely. No it doesn't.That way Diane and I will have had the same experience.It's the only way we can move past this.Well if it helps us move past this I guess Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Cue the Kiss Cam.Oh if only I'd had a Kiss Cam for Catcher In The Rye.Well just one more regret on a long list of many.Todd there you are.You're missing a pretty big moment out there.I don't care.You said it yourself.Without that pen I'm totally worthless.Not for nothing but you were worthless before you didn't get the pen.I really tried this time.I guess I'll never really amount to anything.Well maybe you just need someone to believe in you.Wow no one's ever fallen for that!  What?  You're so stupid! You had the pen and you just gave it to me?! Oh I can't believe that worked.Oh my God look at your stupid face.The pen is just a symbol.It doesn't Yeah said the girl who doesn't have a pen right now.Unbelievable.You are the most annoying immature aggravating irritating crazymaking Oh she was mad all right.But kids? That's the story of how I met this pen.Hey get out of Hair and Makeup and give me back my pen! I got your pen.That means you respect me. No it does not. Viva Toddfoolery! Suck a dick dumbshits.Hey! Hey hey! Well that stern but supple kiss puts you over the top.BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.Well played Jockjam Doorslam.You've earned $500000 for charity.You can walk away right now or and remember this is for charity you can risk it all in our Double or Nothing round.I wanna risk it all!

1," Slaaaaaaaves That was and I don't say this lightly worse than a hundred September 11ths.Yeah you're right.This was stupid.I don't know what I was thinking. Well guess I'll give up forever. That's the spirit.Now you have to understand that as a port city Liverpool had unique access to all aspects of American culture especially Blues music and its unruly nephew Rock and Roll.I thought this story was about running into Paul McCartney in the bathroom at the Golden Globes.It is.I thought you would appreciate some context.Let's skip that one for a minute. Tell me about Todd. Todd? What's to tell? Five years ago he found his way into one of my house parties and never left.And you've never asked him anything about himself? I've asked him to get a job I've asked him to move out.With a little encouragement I'll bet he could really flourish.I mean didn't you have anyone who helped you  when you were just starting out?  Um actually no.Todd clearly thinks the world of you.Todd thinks the world of PopTarts.Look I get that helping other people is not your thing but What? I let Todd live rentfree in my stately manse.I am his own personal Mother Teresa.But do you let him stay here because you're kind or just because you're terrified of being alone? That is insane! I would love to be alone.That is all I want.Mmm if that were really true I don't think you'd be clipping Todd's wings all the time.What? That's unbelievable. Todd!  What? Clean up my shit? Yes but also I would like to help you with your dumbass rock opera. What?  I am supporting you.II don't understand.Oh my God are you dying? No.I think you have great depth of untapped potential and I wish to mentor you in your art. Really?  Yes.Wait is this going to be like that time you promised to take me ice skating and I got really excited about the ice skating but then instead of ice skating you left me at home so you could go to the strip club and then you took the strippers ice skating?  No. Then hooray! Let's dig in.Where to start? Okay well the headline is I hate it.I hate everything about it.The premise is bad and the execution is also bad.It's an irredeemable jumble of shit. Tough but fair. Ahem.That said I don't see why we can't make something really great here.Okay thank you.I'll work on that. Are you close?  No!  How 'bout now?  No!  Now?  You're not even inside of me.Oh God! Did you get there? Okay so you know in the second act closer when the seekers of Newtopia are in the Turbidians' dungeon and they learn their ship  has been destroyed?  No.Well what if we move that to the fourth act? I have no idea what you're talking about but that idea is terrible.I hear the note.Let me see what I can do.And that's why this planet suuuuucks  So?  How can I put this? Imagine if the Holocaust happened every four years like the Olympics.I would rather that happened than your rock opera.That's not really a note.In fact none of your notes have been notes.I feel like you're not even listening.Yeah well you know what? Maybe I would listen if the Turbidians had some reason to enter the Cave of Swollen Dreams that didn't break the pact they made in act one  with Queen Darneesa. You have been listening.This just doesn't make sense.The Turbidians are a loyal people.They they wouldn't betray their queen.Unless They were working for Queen Darneesa who gave them a potion that would counteract the effects of the Elixir of Failed Remembrance so they could bring the secret knowledge from the cave back to her and then establish Newtopia as a vassal state to the Craterman kingdom! Well don't just sit there! Get this down! Oh you like that. You like daddy's good stuff?  Not especially.Did you get there? Okay what if there isn't a robot army? I think you just blew this thing wide open.We'll make this our Newtopiaaa  # Up a fifth #  # Ah #  # Down a fifth #  # Aaah # That was great! This train is moving.Let's take a break and get lunch. Wait you want to get lunch with me?  Yeah that's right.Is this like the time you invited me to lunch but then when I got to the restaurant you texted me to tell me you weren't coming because you were at a strip club eating stripper"" for lunch  and also it was my birthday?  No."

Extra mulch oh no!"" So on the drive home he throws the bag of mulch out the window over the side of the 101."
1," So how can I spend a lot of money? I know.I'll take a spa day. Uh  Eyes prepare to receive cucumbers. We're in a meeting. You know what they say: You gotta skip meetings to have meetings."
1, so I'm a little tired.
1," So making TV is like a fulltime job? Then why is it so bad? I just assumed people weren't trying.Uh I don't mean to butt in here but shouldn't your daughter be in school? Shouldn't you be Sir MindingYourOwnBusinessALot""? I graduated early and took a gap year."
1," So the reason you think I'm right for the role is because I'm a big enough star to secure funding? Don't get smart BoJack.You're not good at it.You're really giving the hard sell here.I hear they've got you locked in to some fantasy dystopia thing.Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit for the rest of your life? For work or like in general? I saw something in you something most people don't know you have and it kills me that instead of sharing it with the world you want to hide it under some wonderland unicorn nonsense.It's a Pegasus.Unicorns are for babies.The movie I want to make isn't glamorous or sexy.You don't get to be the big hero everybody loves.You get to be a guy who works at a gas station who gets in a fight with his daughter about jellybeans.That's the whole movie.It's small and it's real.And you'd get to work with a director who sees you.And I can't sell it any better than that.You're right that one scene we shot that didn't even make it into the Secretariat movie was the best thing I ever did.Why am I wasting my time with this other stuff?  So you're in?  Let's do it.Great.How's your little friend with the face? Is he up to his old tricks getting into scrapes? What a little scamp.Will you tell him I said hi? Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.Is it the nobody'sgonnaseeit element or the fact you'll be working for peanuts? This jellybean thing could show the world that BoJack's more than just a movie star. He's an actor. Yeah well that's great but I've been working all day on getting him the Pegasus movie you said would show the world he's a movie star.I don't want that anymore.I want to do something real.You realize how much money we'd be walking away from? This isn't about money.Doesn't matter to me. Yeah it doesn't matter to you. Right.So what's the problem? Maybe you can find a way for BoJack to do both? You're supposed to be this amazing agent after all.I'll see what I can do.New beers for the new year's? We got a regular Maya Angelou over here.Good times.Oh it's Todd.Gotta take this. Maybe you can call him back later?  Todd! Don't be too long or I'm gonna drink all your beer.Diane do you ever look up at the stars and feel like they're tiny holes in the sky sucking out all the oxygen and suddenly you can't breathe because you're thinking about how small you are and how meaningless it all is? Uh I guess.It's so cruel to let people love you.All you're doing is promising you'll one day break their hearts.Cool fire pit.So it turns out men love safe spaces for women even more than women do.You gotta read some of these comments.Queefburglar69 says These sexy lady chauffeurs always get me where I need to go."
1," So what do you say?  Want to be my star?  Seriously? Of course I do.Of course Herb.Jesus Christ thank you.Mmhmm Whoa whoa.I think you got the wrong idea here. Yeah no man.Whoa. Herb I'm not Me either.No I just You know  I caught up in the moment. Yeah no I gotcha.BJ can you believe it?

Did my character suddenly forget that he didn't want to wear the sweater? No see that's actually the joke."
1," So what do you think BoJack? That's a courtesy question.I already know what you think because I have conversations like this one five times a day.I know who you are and I know you've already made your decision.But if you want to surprise me now's the time to do it.That's what I thought.You're doing the right thing.I know it's hard.But if Herb's really your friend he'll understand.Now you've got a show to put on so I'll let you get ready.This was a good conversation.Productive.If you're lucky I'll never talk to you again.[cup thuds] [sighs] [announcer] You folks ready for a show?

Oh this is the happiest moment of my life."
1," So what's the deal with you and this guy? You never talk about him.Well I kind of maybe stabbed him in the back.Yeah it's a bit of a story.A story of power betrayal and ambitious hairstyles.The year? 198  Movie's over. Watch the next one.Aw I'm tired of watching movies. Do you want to play a game?  Sure.I spy with my little eye someone who needs to shut the hell up. Is it me?  It's always you. Now where was I?

1," Stop leaving voicemails! Admit it! You like my girlfriend.Oh come on.I mean am I attracted to her? Sure.Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah.Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably.Do I fantasize about her? Yes but only in two positions.Look am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure of course but do I like her? The answer's no.You have nothing to worry about.I'll cut you a deal.I help you get rid of that D and you never talk to Diane again.Well I have to talk to her because she's writing my book.Okay but just don't pursue her romantically?  Deal. Ha!  I knew I'd get that handshake. I regret this already.Spread them wide ladies.This is a random cavity search.Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.Did we just say that  Oh!  At the same time? Look I saw you talking to Klaus in the shower.Now the Aryan's are good guys.Don't get me wrong.But I don't know if you're gonna get the right attention over there.Uh I'd hate to get lost in a shop that big.Now we can't offer you the works but in the Latin Kings you'll be a star.We're number two and that means we try harder.Am I really being courted by two gangs? Oh I feel like the belle of the ball.So this is the shapeless biographer I've heard so much about.We've met several times.Did you just call me here to insult me? What is your secret lady? I mean how do you get two grown men fighting over you like a foul ball at a football game? First of all football doesn't have foul balls.Ugh sports.Second of all nobody's fighting over me.Open your eyes.BoJack's clearly in love with you.Wha? Get out of here! Get out of here? Why would I get out of here? You get out of here.This is my office.I get the army men are police but what's the mustard packet again? Oh that's just a mustard packet. It's left over from lunch. Oh.Well can we move it off the table? No.I still might want it later.Good call.So how do we get the D from here all the way up to here? What with all these cops and mustards  it's gonna be a pickle. Oh no.The pickle's a SWAT van but I see your point.Might be easier to just ditch the evidence.But how? I I don't know.You think these coffees would get the juices flowing.Well they do have Bailey's in them.Is that why I feel drunk? Because I've had like seven or eight coffees.I mean I admit it's been bad for ideas but it's been great for camaraderie.Couldn't agree more.Ooh hey.What time is it? I probably need to move my helicopter.It's in a twohour zone.You beautiful bastard that's it! We can pick up the D with your chopper fly it out of here and then dump it out into the ocean.Stupendous! Take that the ocean. What now Todd?  Listen.So kind of landed myself in a twodatestotheprom situation.The dates being prison gangs and the prom being a jumpin so do you remember how you got out of the same jam on Horsin' Around? Ah a classic conundrum.Well I recall one time on Mr.Peanutbutter's House I think he's talking to me pal.You know the guy whose show invented the twodatestotheprom story.You may have invented it but I think our show perfected it.The only thing you ever perfected  was stealing my thunder. Stealing your thunder eh? Now you're even stealing the words I'm saying.You know it's tough.I agree with the Latin Kings on social issues but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.Well juggling both never ends well.Mr.Peanutbutter anything to contribute? He's just staring blankly now.Stealing your thunder.You could also just bail me out of here as I said. It's only 50 bucks  Got to go pal.Hope it's a magical night.All right you ready for the plan? Oh yeah.But we are gonna need a big distraction to keep the eyes off the skies.You leave that to me.Whoa wait.You had a lot to drink.You better have a cup of coffee.Who loves you people? Look this way news media.A celebrity is throwing away his hardearned cash.Everyone pay attention to me.Oh it's only onedollar bills folks.Don't bother.No it's still free spendable money.This is a huge story.Dollars are like the new penny.Yeah.Cash is for poor people.What is wrong with you bozos? Just riot over the damn money already.Well nothing to see here I guess.Ooh ooh Whoa! Jesus Christ my ankle Oh my God.American singersongwriter Beyonc is hurt.Somebody help her! Ring the alarm.Irreplaceable pop icon and independent woman Beyonc has been injured.What more can you give us? Details are sketchy at this point but we do know Beyonc is a survivor and presumably she will keep on surviving. But what happened?  Well Tom I'm being told she fell on all the single dollars. All the single dollars?  All the single dollars.All the single dollars?  All the single dollars. Bills bills bills.We promise to provide live unflinching coverage of this harrowing ordeal of a star gone from dangerously in love to dangerously in peril.Don't stop watching.Mr.Peanutbutter take her home.Doctors have confirmed that Beyonc will never perform again.This just in.A break in the story of the Hollywoo heist.We now go live to the house of Mr.Peanutbutter star of Mr.Peanutbutter's House.Ah jeez.What did that idiot do? Ladies and gentlemen of the press I and I alone stole the D from the Hollywoo sign.Just tell us why'd you do it? Oh I'll tell you why.I did it all for my girlfriend Diane.Aww.Son of a bitch.That literal son of a bitch.If you're joining us Mr.Peanutbutter has confessed to stealing the D for his girlfriend Diane in what many are calling the most romantic gesture in the history of romance and gestures.We now await the L.A.P.D.'s move.The day they make love a crime is the day I turn in my badge.And here's our lady of the hour now Diane.Diane! What do you think? Wow Mr.Peanutbutter uh it's kind of a lot.I don't really like to be on camera.And? Do you love anything or anyone? I got to go.We'll talk about it later.Ooh Oh my Todd.You look You look beautiful holmes.What? This old thing? The guards made me wear it.Yeah well it suits you.You're an autumn bro.Ahh.It's good right? Oh.Come meet my boy Santiago.Uh you know I'll I'll be right back.I I left my cot unmade.Ooh watch it.Oh sorry I'm late.Hope you didn't think I was pulling an Anne Frank on you.Good one.Can you believe it? I was doublecrossed by the one man I assumed was too stupid to even singlecross.What? I have no idea what you're talking about.I do have a life outside of you you know.Mr.Peanutbutter took my D and gave it to Diane.Once again he completely ripped me off.Oh right.That whole thing.Just a minute Cate.Look you may have come up with a log line but he's the one who sold the pitch.This is more on brand for him than it is for you. What do you mean?  Desecrated a major landmark in a drunken stupor that's a BoJack Horseman thing.But stealing it for your girlfriend as a grand display of affection? That's Mr.Peanutbutter.You're right.It's Mr.Peanutbutter all over.It's the kind of bold romantic gesture they base movies on.Actually that's not a bad idea.Lora? Check if anyone's bought the rights yet.Can we keep this about me please? Even if he stole your stealing of the D what he made his was telling Diane how he felt from his heart.You could never say it to me and you still can't say it to her.That's not true.I can express feelings.Nothing on the outside.Nothing on the inside.Look I got to bounce.Quick question though.Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun? Why are you wasting my time with this?  Of course I would.Who wouldn't?  Huh.And that's why Eva Braun was like the fifth Beatle of the Third Reich.Wow.I never knew neoNazis were so interested in Nazis.You got some great moves Todd.You dance like a white man and I love it.Hey no disrespect but I got a few chess pieces I forgot need whittling.Oh excuse me.Oh thank God you're back.I was getting nervous that you left me for another gang.If that happened I'd have to kill you.Thank you for rescheduling given your recent uh everything.Yeah.That was really something.I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller? Yeah but for some reason the jury's Stiller out on how I feel about it.Well that's because it wasn't for you.That wasn't a Diane thing.It was a Mr.Peanutbutter thing.Well what would be a Diane thing? A Diane thing would be something that shows he really knows you like giving you an iPod loaded with all your favorite podcasts or a practical houseplant or surprising you with a bound album of photos and emails he saved.That's That's what the Diane I know would want.What are you saying to me? Just that you should be with someone who knows you.Yeah? Like who? I Whoa were we Were we taping? Um okay.Uh you want to hear my Andy Dick story? It's a doozie.All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered.Drugs cigarettes.I mean that's the standard gang rate.Hey I got to go uh do a prison thing.That sounds legitimate.We are in prison after all.Whew.Hey.White people right? Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan are you dressed like a Latin King?  Uh what  What the hell bro?  Are you playing both sides?  Look guys I didn't want to choose between you because I like you both.Look in fact if you just took the time to get to know each other the way you did me I think you'd agree we don't need gangs anymore because deep down we're all just people.What do you say? This just in.A standoff at the Super Max has turned into a fullon race war.But first America has fallen in love with Hollywoo itcouple Mr.Peanutbutter and Diane Diane? Is that you? Hey.It's um me.Look uh things got a bit weird earlier so I I want to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow to talk about the time I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.I'm really sorry about before.I know the D was overkill so I got you something more personal.Aww.I also wanted to just um let you know how much I appreciate you working on this book with me.I know I sometimes get carried away but it's because I love you so much.You're a catch Diane and I think you know how much I love catch.And I'm sorry if I've been difficult in any way during this process.You know it's It's really hard to have somebody I don't know know you I guess.And you do uh know me Diane.We're very different but I think we bring out the best in each other.It's like you're chocolate and I'm  Peanutbutter?  What? Now see? That was so much better than what I was gonna say.I was gonna say carrots.And I know I'm not the perfect guy.I actually kind of hate myself a lot of the time.But when When I'm with you I uh don't hate myself.I like being around you and I don't know if I ever told you that in so many words so I'm telling you.Diane I've got an important question to ask.No cameras no big spectacle.Just me and you.Call me back.This was BoJack by the way.Horseman obviously.Will you do the honor Of becoming Mrs.Peanutbutter? Wow.This is happening so fast.Yes.I'll marry you.But I'm keeping my last name.You hear that? She said yes! Let's kick it! Erica did you hear she said yes? Come on in here! All right!

Yep. No it isn't.Yeah it is.You want those guys to be proud of you?

What? What? Get out of here.I got to say BoJack that is a relief.Hoho! Whoo! Hey do you guys want to grab dinner?

But I'd instead like to highlight the fact that Mr.Peanutbutter's ripping off my toast the same way he ripped off my entire career.Uh we prefer gifts over observations.Okay.Well here's something I didn't rip off.This brand new helicopter I just bought.Whoowhoo! Who wants a ride in the chopper? Okay guys.This has been fun and also an offensive display of extravagant wealth but maybe we should call it a night.What's the rush? Because I just bought the restaurant and we can stay as long as we want.Hey you.I own you now.Do a dance.Oops.Oh no.Hey sorry bud. It's all yours. Please you first.Apparently we both like to be clean.I love being clean.That's so coincidental. I'm Todd. Klaus.Look I know you're new here being white into cleansing.I think you'd enjoy hanging out with me and the gang.When you say the gang"" do you mean a gang?

There will be no shenanigans on my watch.Professor Thistlethorpe the famously humorless yet somehow also lovable ski instructor? Peanutbutter is it? Everything about you disgusts me.Uh And yet there might be something in you after all.You really mean it? This shall be my greatest challenge.Meet me on the summit tomorrow at daybreak.Well it is daybreak and here we are at the summit.First lesson break your skis in half.Oh I don't have skis.Was I supposed to bring skis?  You didn't say that. No bother.They shan't be required.Instead read this book of poetry.I'll see you in the classroom.Ah there you are.Did you read the book of poetry? No! I forgot to. Excellent. I'm sor Excellent? My assignment was a test.Skiing isn't about reading old books. It's about speaking truth to power  Oh! and you have spoken it eloquently.You are my finest student.I love you.[COUGHING]  Are you okay professor?  Just a cough.I'm sure it's nothing.You can come by tomorrow for your diploma.I can't believe ski school is already over.Professor Thistlethorpe? Professor Thistlethorpe! [WEAKLY] Remember everything I taught you.I will.Also if you have any tips for skiing that would be really helpful.The most important part of skiing is to keep your legs ben [SOBBING] Who's Ben? Devil's Mountain is the place skiing is the sport.I'm uncomfortable.It's cold out.Tell me who do you think will win today's bout and what does it mean for the future of California? I hate winter sports.I want to go inside and drink a cider. [STARTER'S PISTOL FIRING]  And they're off! [GRUNTS YELLING] [TOM] Woodchuck off to a great start.Mr.Peanutbutter seems to be employing some sort of awkwardly falling down technique. Any sign of them?  Nothing yet. Oh! I made you a card. You did? [CHUCKLES] Oh wow it's sparkly.Sorry I went a little overboard with the glitter and a little underboard with the glue.[RALPH] Let's move in together."
1," This light bulb won't let me in to your house without paying.Ah sorry about that.Gotta raise those funds. Can't I just  Thanks for your support buddy. Means so much.Erica!  Hey Look at you with the right number of ears!  Look I just  Twenty thousand dollars a plate.[GROWLS]  Hmm!  [POPS] Oh.Hey do you have another bathroom? They're all occupied and I gotta pee.Not because I'm pregnant or anything.Because if I were pregnant it would be bad luck to tell you this early.Presuming it was early.But I'm not pregnant.This is just a normal nonpregnant gal type of having to pee. There's a bathroom in the pool house. You're a lifesaver.Pardon me! Out of my way.Uhoh.Am I in Ithaca? Because you are looking gorges"" this evening."
1," Those are off the top of my head they're all gold.I'm surprised you're so into the idea.I've been having trouble getting networks on the phone but with a big star like you attached we could sell this right away.I wouldn't say I'm attached Don't move.I'm getting the next flight down to LA. Right now?  And purchased.BoJack for the last 20 years I've been telling people I didn't need the trappings of fame that I was better off happy with my little Bplus life at my little Bplus hardware store in little Bplus Olympia Washington.Bminus children.But it's a lie.I miss the warmth of the spotlight on my face.The thrill of telling a joke and feeling it land.Is that a thrill you experienced? The sitcom stage is my home and I'm tired of denying myself that.I'm ready to come home.Great. Why did you let me call him?  Ugh.Ah smell that Labrador Peninsula air.Keep an eye out for my brother. How will I know which one's him?  He's the one that looks like me.Got it. Hello?  Hey Mr.Peanutbutter.Is this an okay time to talk business? Yeah I'm just waiting for Captain Peanutbutter.What is that like a cereal? No my brother. He's picking us up at the airport. Nice.Speaking of driving people places Cabracadabra had a killer holiday season and I think New Year's is going to be even bigger.I'm loving that segue Todd.You are a conversational Magellan.Turns out there's a huge demand for a safe space for women.Who knew? Honestly never would've crossed my mind.So I was thinking what's the next step? What if we made our safe space for women also available to men? That's an untapped market.All right then it's agreed.No goodbye? He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.Mr.Peanutbutter and Captain Peanutbutter in the same room? What is this a flashback episode? Captain Peanutbutter you old soandso. Get over here. Careful.Where's Mrs.Captain Peanutbutter? She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.She sends her love.And this noogie.Whoo! Diane this is my big brother.Big brother? I'm five minutes older.And you always will be.It's nice to meet you Captain.Hey put that thing away.You're family.Oh! So David Pincher is about to shoot the Flight of the Pegasus trilogy in New Zealand and BoJack is perfect for the lead.A part like that would really underline that BoJack's more than just an actor he's a movie star.If I'm doing that I conveniently won't be able to do that dumbass Ethan Around show.Use that when you tell him I won't do it.Why don't you tell him you don't want to do it? I can't.I'm like a father figure to him I slept with his mother. Gross. No.I slept with her 20 years ago.She was young then not gross.Ugh! Hey loved you in The Caveman's Valentine. Hmm?  Nothing? The Caveman's Valentine? Samuel L.Jackson had that big beard? Look it up. When you start laughing call me. Will do.Do we have an offer on the Pegasus movie? I'll get it Kalamata.Don't get your pita in a wad.Wow.Flight of the Pegasus.This must be what Robert Downey Jr.felt like when he woke up on that stranger's bathroom floor and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.It's another unseasonably warm day in the Labrador Peninsula and things are looking sunny all the way to the new year.It really is true what they say Nothing bad ever happens on the Labrador Peninsula.Oh paradise.Uncle Mister.Uncle Mister.Now who let these little monsters onto my peninsula? We're your nephews.What? I don't remember my nephews being made out of candy.Gobble gobble gobble.Look at those children.Little miracles right? They're adorable not that I value them based on their looks.Because of course children in society today are often reduced to their cuteness.I can't wait to get to know your children as people so I can specifically compliment them individually on the foundation of their characters.Well one day they'll die just like us.Uh  Do you believe in the soul?  What? Life is the most precious resource we have.Remember that Diane.Okay.Pretty great right? Did you tell your brother about the ABORTION? The audition? No I could never tell him about that.He thinks I'm offeronly it would break his heart.Wait what audition?  No the abortion. Oh no.Should I have? He said some weird stuff to me earlier.The kind of stuff you'd hear in a sad Creed song.Or a happy Elliott Smith song.Oh he's probably just razzing ya but he's a good dog.All bark no bite.Sorry that's a Labrador expression.I guess in human terms it would be: He's all talk and no shooting you with an assault rifle.Is that what you think humans do? Am I wrong? Boom! This is David Pincher.And this is everyone who works for him.Now unfortunately for us everyone on this board must really like their boss's movies because for the holidays they're all Gone Girl.Thank you except for her.Boom.The assistant to David Pincher's casting director.Wait a second I know that face.Why does she look so familiar?  Oh fish. Oh fish.So when I found out that the best assistant I ever had was working for David Pincher I mean what are the odds? Did he hire you because of your cute little Benjamin Buttonnose? I'll put in a good word for BoJack but I'm just an assistant.Just an assistant? Laura assistants are everything.You're the first people in the last people out.You know everyone's real name age nose teeth and tits.You have power because in today's economy the only true power is information.I want you to use that power.I want you to get your boss to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.I always believed in you Laura.do you believe in yourself? Wow that's I'm sorry did you just make that up? Because that was Is that a speech you had ready to go?  Will you do this for me?  Of course.You went to bat for me when I tried to get a promotion at Vigor.I pushed so hard for you.I did everything I could.I mean we gals gotta look out for each other.Right? Right.So you're talking about a merger? Since my dad croaked I've been running Vigor myself and I've been doing a pretty good job Aminus/Bplus.But I could use a few more experienced hands to help guide the ship  because being a boss is really hard. Yes.Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.I'm glad you came to me first.I would have gone to her directly but sometimes she yells at me and I do not like being yelled at and that is just something that people need to understand about me.I'll talk to her when the time is right.So on the new show Ethan is the dad and he's raising three little horses.You couldn't have told me this over the phone? This show is going to change my life.I'm taking the kids out of school and moving everyone down here.I just had an offer accepted on a house in Sherman Oaks.As long as I don't change my mind before the new year boom.Two million dollars gone. The new year? That's tonight. I know.Did you talk to my agent by any chance?  No. She didn't call you? I talked to her and I don't know if she wants me to do it.You know how agents are.Just remember I'm not the bad guy here.I hear you loud and clear.Don't worry.We won't take no for an answer.I think my schedule's gonna be tough Might be going to New Zealand.We'll work around your schedule.Those bastards got my quote so damn high.We'll pay it.No obstacle is insurmountable. As long as you want to do it. And I do want to do it.Get me out of this thing.This asshole's giving me everything I ask for.What a nightmare.Tell him you don't want to do the show.I can't.It would destroy him.Destroying people is what I pay you to do so I don't think about the people I'm destroying.Do you not know what an agent is? BoJack are you okay in there? Is it number one or number two? That cat's running circles around us.What are we going to do? Maybe we can distract her? I'm thinking laser pointer.If we're going to beat her we need to think like her.Instead of convincing the Pegasus people they don't want BoJack what if we convince BoJack he doesn't want Pegasus? Fantastic.How do we do that? Kelsey.Kelsey? That's what I said when they said you wanted to meet with me.I figured you never wanted to see me again.I never want to see anyone again but there's a book I've been trying to turn into a movie and I need your help.It's a comingofage story about a girl who likes jellybeans.The option expires tonight at midnight unless I can find a big enough star to secure funding.Frankly I already gave up on it.Then my agent said Maybe BoJack's interested."
1," Ugh.Could you imagine having a kid? Eww.I'm Terry Gross and this is your ring tone.I'm here with novelist Jonathan Lethem.Jonathan how did you become a ring tone? You know Terry growing up in Brooklyn I was always fascinated by ring tones and the stories they told.Hey Mr.Peanutbutter.Hello my precious darling slice of sunshine who I am not putting on a pedestal.Just calling for our daily download as per Dr.Janet's friendly but firm suggestion.When do you think you'll be home?

Oh sure.I haven't seen you much since you moved out of my deck chairs.You know I've been focusing on my new job and my marriage and  And avoiding me?  I'm not avoiding you.I'm just making an effort to not be in a room alone with you  because I am avoiding you. Oh.You know I think we're alike in a lot of ways.I always tell people you're like the notcool version of me.Sometimes that's great but it also means we can bring out the worst in each other.I'm trying to get my life back on track.I just think maybe it's better for both of us if we keep things a little more professional.Yes okay.Professional.BoJack and Diane being professional.Doing our jobs and nothing else.We're at the place I needed to go to.It's so weird I drove here on accident.Might as well run in and grab that thing I need to get.Then back to business. It's spooky in here.Too spooky. Really? And what would be the right amount of spooky? Jesus this thing's heavy.Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms got so jacked.Put it down BoJack.Does it look weird? Me with an Oscar?  I actually think that it feels  Oh my God. I think she's dead. Hold on maybe she's not dead.Maybe she's just being a a whale? No she's dead.Maybe there's someone in her phone we can call.Diane kids these days don't call.They communicate via a combination of text messages  eye rolls and dick pics. Oh my God.What is it? Dick pics? See if they spell out a message.Freeze! Drop the Oscar!  Oh man. Well well well.Or should I say whale whale whale? Killer whale that is.Or should I say killed whale?

I checked her into Promises.How did it feel to check the girl you raised on television into rehab? It was tough.I would have liked to reconnect with her.At least we got to bond a little on the drive to Malibu.I can see my organs.Oh whoa! She is losing a lot of blood BoJack.Beautiful day for a drive though huh? Well maybe the two of you can catch up some more when she gets out of rehab.People don't usually want to hang out with me after rehab.I'm really more of a beforerehab friend.I think it's gonna be a long time before I see Sarah Lynn again.Who could that be? Look BoJack I appreciate what you were trying to do but I don't need rehab.Look good as new huh? Oh great well that's a relief.Uh should you be taking all those pills?

Oh my God.You should be on TV which holy shit they're flat now.Actually I was on.You know what I'm sick of talking about me.Let's talk about you.Next thing I know I'm waking up from a 30year coma.So now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch but it's not ideal.She's molting.You know how sisters are.Oh jeez got a couple curly guys in here with the regulars.How hard is it to look before they bring it out? Excuse me miss? I know isn't it cool? Like we're getting away with something.What? Don't you love it when appetizers have a little crossover episode? It's like when you're watching Happy Days and Mork shows up.Oh yeah I guess.Or like when Kramer was on Murphy Brown.Who? Hey you want to get out of here? I don't want MBN to just be another boring old network you know what I mean? Yes totally.I want to take risks.I want to swing for the fences you know? Otherwise what are we doing?

Sorry about that needle skip folks.Let's start that song again from the beginning.I'm Alex.Wanda.And I'm BoJack.It's been really tough for me these last few weeks.I've never seen Home Alone and everyone makes me feel like a freak because of it.You've never seen Home Alone? I've never seen it! Also I don't really know what a DVR is.Neither do I! No one does.It's just a magic box.Wanda we have so much in common.Really it's just one thing.You can't count each individual thing as a different thing.That's like saying I have a lot in common with Kanye West because we both breathe air.Who? Jinx.Buy me a Coke Zero.What's a Coke Zero? I have no idea.We gotta hang out more.I didn't know there was anyone else like me.Give me your fax and pager number so I can add them to my Rolodex.Tubular.I don't trust that guy.I bet he's seen Home Alone.BoJack I'm starting to lose the thread of your character.You think you can drop the jealous boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.You're right I'm sorry.Call me Snoop Dogg because I will drop it like it's hot.BoJack I don't I got that one! Snoopy the dog.From Peanuts."

Just how nice things could've been if you had chosen this life.What? Where? Hello? BoJack I read the pages you sent me last night and I have to tell you your book is absolutely without a doubt the most gibberish. It's gibberish. What day is it? Let's see what you got here.You got 20 pages of Doctor Who erotic fan fiction a recipe for soup five different theories about how 9/11 happened and a bunch of embedded YouTube videos that can't possibly be printed in book form.Okay I gotta go.Any questions at all for our panel of ghostwriters?

Does anyone have an actual question for someone on this panel? An actual question or a gun so I can shoot myself? Yeah I got a question.Thank God.My question is for Diane.Look I'm sorry about all the stuff I said about you earlier.We can publish the book you wrote.You're obviously a better writer than I am and I don't actually even really care what the world thinks about me anymore.I just hated reading that book because I hated feeling like that's how you saw me.Because I guess you know me better than anybody and if you think that Um I guess my question is do you Do you think it's too late for me? What? I mean am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The The person in that book? It's not too late for me is it? It's It's not too late Diane I need you to tell me that it's not too late. BoJack I  I I need you to tell me that I'm a good person.I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and selfdestructive but underneath all that deep down I'm a good person and I need you to tell me that I'm good Diane.Tell me please Diane.Tell me that I'm good.Hey aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?

I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.When I left I swore I would never work at a big agency again because I can't work with people like that.You don't think I'm like that? No because you care about people other than yourself.And for what it's worth you will be a wonderful mother. You're not just saying that?  I never just say anything.I choose words very carefully with an eye towards precision and expediency.I'm surprised you haven't noticed that. Good night Judah. Mmhmm.Okay. It's about time Henrietta. You're welcome.Go talk to her idiot.Drink first.No you stupid alcoholic.Talk to your daughter.You're ruining her.You know that right?

Just drive around.Sometimes I go to a bar.Sometimes I pull over by the side of the road just sit there for hours.Why? And you'd rather do that  than spend time with me?  Hollyhock I know you didn't ask for this dorky 17yearold to just show up at your door.And I'm sorry if I'm annoying but I didn't ask  No Hollyhock I'm glad you're here. Oh.If I'm shitty that's just because I'm shitty.You're allowed to be mad at me but you need to know that whatever I do it's not your fault.I know.I mean I know but I don't always know you know? Like sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes like Hey everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!"" I know what you mean."
1," Well I wish you the best of luck.You know what your problem is? You think you're so much smarter than everybody.Well guess what.I spent as much time with you as you did with me.Why don't I write a book about how you married Mr.Peanutbutter because he's too dumb to see how much better you think you are?  Okay I know you're upset  I'm not upset.I'm just sick of nerdgirls like you beating up on stars like me.It's pathetic! I'm sorry no one wanted to date you in high school Diane but I don't see why I have to suffer just because you were never especially pretty or interesting.You really let me down BoJack.You really let me down.I apologize for her outbursts.So you really think you could write a better book by Friday? Damn right I can so you can throw this turd of a book in the garbage and then light the garbage on fire.In fact you can burn all books because my book written by me is gonna kick your dick off.Okay chapter one.Not quite right.What? Why are you rewriting the book bozo? Diane's version is great.You're gonna lose gems like this one Ahem.The only longstanding relationship in BoJack's life is with his agent Princess Carolyn."
1," Well it's a working title.Well it could be working harder and that's wordplay.How'd you even get in here? Your roommate let us in.Mi casa es su casa.And that is the last of the Toaster Strudels and now my morning is ruined.Could you guys keep it down okay? I'm kind of on a date right now.In America I am actually considered very handsome.Okay I'm gonna go get breakfast and when I get back I want everyone out of my house except for you and you and  Who are you again?  The girl you had sex with.Right.You definitely should have already been gone.I really shouldn't eat chocolate 'cause it can literally kill me.Oh I know. But I love chocolate. Story of my life.Hey excuse me.Yes I am BoJack Horseman star of Horsin' Around.Yeah okay I don't care.Those are my muffins.I'm sorry I I don't understand.Did you bring them into the store with you? No but I was going to buy them.That's the last box and I had dibs on them.Really? You had dibs? Yeah dibs.I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom.Look I don't even want the muffins.I was just looking at them but I got to say if you put muffins down they're not your muffins.So what I was supposed to take them into the bathroom with me? You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.You just left them out here.Yeah in the produce section.Clearly muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section.That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs? Look I don't want to get into a whole thing here.Then give me the muffins.No 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.You think that because you're a pseudocelebrity normal rules don't apply to you? Pseudo? Would you say that to Eric McCormack? Look I've had a rough morning so I don't need You've had a rough morning? I spent the last ten months Hey! Sorry wasn't listening.See ya.You're going to regret this BoJack Horseman.Oh really? I'm gonna regret buying muffins? What have they got a lot of saturated fat in them? Oh man they do have a lot of saturated fat.Why'd I buy these? Man I really regret buying those muffins and then eating them all on the drive home.Well my date with Ayako went really well.Thanks for asking.I specifically didn't ask and I'll thank you to respect my total lack of interest in your personal life.She's hilarious.I never met a girl who was so curious about American bank routing numbers.Still not interested.Should we get started on the book? What's your hurry? What do you guys think I should get Ayako for our 12hour anniversary? She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name.Okay let's get to work.Let's start at the beginning.What was your childhood like?  Normal. Normal? Yeah it was uh normal normal childhood stuff.Here's your omelet.I'm sorry it's not as good as the omelets your secretary makes but then you're not married to your secretary are you? Well maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion I would be.Mommy can I have an omelet? You're the birthday boy.Normal childhood and then just get right into the big famous part.Look if you're not ready to talk we can wait.I am ready to talk.Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents? They're so normal.That's crazy.You sound like a crazy person not me.Stop being so crazy crazy.Why are you calling me crazy? Okay.Was your father Hold on I got to take this.Hello? Hey BoJack I've got Princess Carolyn for you. It's urgent. Great put her on.Just a sec.I'll see if she's available.d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And d BoJack are you watching MSNBSea right now? Great question.Well I didn't fall down on my remote randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea while simultaneously crippling myself thus physically forcing me to watch MSNBSea so no.No I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.Yeah well Hamlet you might want to turn it on.They're talking about you.Ooh! Good things I hope.Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.Welcome to the program Neal.Thank you Tom.Hey I met this guy.All Neal wanted when he got home and I emphasize from Afghanistan was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins.When he went to the supermarket and called dibs on the last box Well tell us what happened Neal.BoJack Horseman from the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around refused to respect my dibs.Have you no shame BoJack Horseman? Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.Oh not the sneezing pic Why do they always use the sneezing picture? In the '90s we laughed at your antics.Oh how we laughed.Ha ha ha"" we chortled in rapturous glee."
1," Well we didn't get the polling research on fracking  Here you go. Thank you.Because apparently when the delivery  came someone wouldn't sign for it. Ooh.In the future whenever anyone asks you to sign Mr.Peanutbutter's name  just sign it. You got it chief.All right MiddleAged Yeller here's what you're gonna do.You're gonna give an impassioned speech on fracking that doesn't actually take a stand either way on fracking.Okay.Good morning! Let's talk fracking.Everyone has very strong opinions about it and I want you all to know right here and right now I am taking a stand.I am on your side!  What side is that specifically?  Good question.I am specifically on the side of the facts and also on the side of feelings.Well I'm satisfied.Oh excuse me would Mr.Peanutbutter be willing to sign this letter to our state government? Yes.I'll write his name on anything.Oh thank you so much.And down goes Todd.And up comes Todd! Aah!  Whoa!  Stay back! Calm down I'm not going to hurt you.My name is Hollyhock ManheimMannheim GuerreroRobinsonZilberschlag  HsungFonzerelliMcQuack. Wait wait wait. What's your first name?  Hollyhock.And your last name? ManheimMannheimGuerreroRobinson ZilberschlagHsungFonzerelliMcQuack.Got it. Wait what's your last name?  I know it's confusing. I have eight dads. How'd that happen? Test tubes?  No.I was adopted. Oh of course.By eight men in a committed gay polyamorous relationship. Less of course. But ever since I was a baby people always said I looked like  BoJack Horseman. That's a terrible thing to say to a baby! And I've always wondered if BoJack could be my biological sperm guy.I guess it's possible.BoJack used to say his penis is like sundried tomatoes: back in the '90s it got into everything.I came to L.A.to get to the bottom of things.I even bought a deluxe spy kit.Sorry about knocking you out.Once you have chloroform you can't not use it.No I get it.BoJack had one of those spy kits too.He mostly just used the chloroform on himself though.I read in his book that you live together. Can you help me find him?  Sorry.I don't live there anymore.And no one knows where he's been for the last year.I guess I don't have to meet him.All I need is a DNA sample like a piece of hair or something.I guess his house might have  Whoa!  Sorry again.It's just so fun.Okay there might be some hairs in the shower drain but hard to know who they belong to.Everyone who has sex with BoJack usually takes a long shower afterwards.Hey I think I see a hair.Oh no BoJack. Yoink!  What the was  Okay. Okay let's blow.Blow? Who's got blow? Save some for BoJack.Huh? Wait Todd? Oh shit.Are you gonna yell at me? Can I have the blow first? No.BoJack there's no blow okay? And I'm not going to yell at you. And what is this?  I'm Hollyhock ManheimMannheimGuerreroRobinson ZilberschlagHsungFonzerelliMcQuack.Of the New Haven Manheim MannheimGuerreroRobinson ZilberschlagHsungFonzerelliMcQuacks? That was a joke.Obviously I've never heard of your family and/or law firm.That was also a joke.Todd who is this tough crowd you brought to my home?  Um BoJack this is your daught  Mmmmm mmmmm! dotdot maid.Way to build up the suspense.To uh tidy up the place in case you came back.You got me a maid? Thank you.Here I thought Channing Tatum was a good neighbor for picking up my mail while I was gone but you and after all the things I did to you  I don't know how to tell you  BoJack we haven't talked in like a year and that's actually been kind of working for me.So maybe it's better if we just keep things like that you know? Oh.Okay.So then why did you hire me Oh yeah deliver me.You're welcome.Now go get that DNA tested.Can you tell me if this is a match?  A match with who?  Hollyhock.ManheimMannheimGorillaRubaDubDub ZoolanderHallelujah somethingMcDonald's? Whatever those words are I need a sample from her too.Duh! Bring it in an hour.I gotta get to lunch.Nothing like working with hair blood and semen all day to work up an appetite and it's already 1:00.1:00? I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend! Oh you have a fake girlfriend too? Mine is a bunch of water balloons with a blonde wig.I suppose a fancy restaurant like this is too fancy for a common man such as yourself.No it's fine.You'd probably like to take me someplace rough and primitive.Uh do you want me to take you somewhere else? Well if you must drag me on some barbaric adventure I can't stop you.There's a Pony Roma's at Universal CityWalk.A chain restaurant? Oh God no I'll be mugged.I can't do this.Todd I can never be your dirty peasant girl I'm sorry. I must abscond. Wait Courtney! Scusi sir would you care for a sample of my father's famous angel hair pomodoro? Famous father? Hair? Sample?  DNA?  I no say DNA.I gotta get back to Hollyhock.Hollyhock I need to get  Did you clean anything?  No.But I am learning so much about my possiblymaybe birth father.Like did you know he has a shoebox in his closet full of bad reviews for other people's TV shows? So all you've done so far is snoop around? I also ate a box of donuts got sleepy and took a nap.Yeah I'm not sure we really need to do this DNA test.Look I didn't come all this way to not find out who my biological father is.Okay fine then I just need you to yank out a strand of hair  so I can take it down to the lab. No way! That sounds painful. Can't we just use your hair?  Um No.No but I can pull out some of my hair at the same time  so you don't have to do it alone. Okay that sounds fair.On three we pull. One two three!  Ow! Oh wait I have this whole comb full of hair in my bag.Duh! Todd can I see you for a minute? This maid is the worst.I passed out again for some reason.When I woke up the house was messier than when she started.I don't mind someone else in the house with me in case I start choking on pills or have a funny take on current events that demands an audience but if she can't do her job I gotta fire her.You can't do that! Here buzz up real nice take a nap and while you're sleeping I'll get the maid to clean so no one has to fire anyone.Well we did it.What? I'm helping.I'm cleaning out his DVR.Get it? Okay but you got it right? ToToToTodd! Todd's phone home of the Todd.You quarterwit.Turn on the news.I don't want to be a manners police but a hello"" would be nice."
1," Well what about giving me Rollerblades? How are people gonna know that my character is hip if he doesn't roll the blade? Just get out there and do your job.Every one of your ideas is stupid or racist.That was one pitch and I didn't say they're all thieves.But if you're too scared to start a national dialogue maybe I'll take my ideas home.Good luck making Horsin' Around without the horse.BoJack hon.That audience out there traveled from all over the country just to taste some of your magic.Do you really want to disappoint them? [sighs] Okay Sharona.I'll go out and jerk this limp script until it gets hard but I'm not doing it for Herb.I'm doing it for the fans.And your 30K an episode.[announcer] Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman! And there better be some Zimas in my dressing room after the show.[cheers and applause] Wait a minute.This isn't the bar.I got to fire my assistant.[laughter] You guys sound like you're ready for a show.[rock music] Oh gross.Why do I keep trying to like Zima? [phone rings]  Talk to me world. BoJack it's Princess Carolyn.How are you doing today? Well I'll tell you my problem. I just keep getting handsomer. [laughs] Good problems to have.Hold for a sec.I've got your agent on the line.[Marv] BoJack Goddamn Horseface.I got some news so good you'll goddamn kiss me.Put it here.Put it here.What's the role you've been dying to play your whole life besides Kathy Ireland's bathing suit? Haha.She is attractive.Good God when I die bury me in Kathy Ireland.Uh Marv? Marv? What's the big news? Secretariat! It's happening and it's down to you and Val Kilmer for the title role.That's amazing.Thank you.Thank you.Now listen.I don't want to see you in any more tabloids.Keep your head down and your nose clean.Now I gotta go.I got a lunch with MC Skat Kat.[man on TV] Scandal breaking today surrounding the family sitcom Horsin' Around.Oh God.What did I do this time? Herb Kazzaz the show's creator was caught tonight in an LAPD sting  on public indecency. Wha Police say Mr.Kazzaz was caught in the middle of lewd acts with another man.Conservative groups have been quick to organize.Horsin' Around is a show for kids.My family should be able to watch those nubile preteens without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting their alternative lifestyles and ruining America.Sheeeiiiiit.BoJack I gotta tell ya. I'm gay. No doy.I know we haven't been close for the past couple years.Okay I'm gonna hold back my No doys"" because there might be a lot."
1," Well yeah but that was just because I wanted to work with Ashton.We'll talk later right? I'm so sorry.Bye.Did you have a good meeting? [MOCKINGLY] Did you get fired? [GROANS] Aw.Sorry you got fired.Here's a latte.Oh uh  It's decaf ma'am. Thanks Judah.You know one year ago a setback like this would have really spun me out.But I don't need Courtney.Every time we fall we get back up stronger and better than ever. Can I get a hallelujah?  Is that a sort of pressed juice? I'll have one hallelujah on your desk by 12:45.Great.What's next? I noticed your necklace was broken so I pushed back your appointment and found a reputable jeweler nearby.Don't know what I'd do without you my hairy number two! Oh God I'm sorry.That came out horribly.Not to speak above my station but perhaps it would behoove us to entice BoJack Horseman back into our stable. Ugh!  I'm sorry ma'am.Stable"" and ""behoove"" were poor word choices."
1," What am I supposed to do with that? Maybe it's a different Secretariat.Ha ha ha ha.No but seriously folks there is no truth to these allegations.I have never bet on horse racing and I certainly did not bet on my own races.Although I did bet the network's gonna give your show back to Joey Bishop.O ho ho kay.We get letters here on the show and one particular letter for you actually struck a chord with our producers.This is from BoJack H.BoJack is nine years old.BoJack writes Dear Secretariat I am a horse just like you."
1," What are we gonna do? Horse maybe you should tell her that her parents aren't coming.I can't do that she'll never believe in Santa Claus again.And we're sure Santa can't bring people back from the dead? On Dancer on Prancer on Necromancer? I'm thinkin' no.Oh my God I got it.Maybe if we can trick her into being bad she'll think Santa's mad at her.That way when Christmas comes and her parents don't show up she'll just think it's her own fault.Brilliant! She'll still believe in Santa plus she'll be extra wellbehaved for the whole year so she doesn't blow it again.Hold on you kids want me to trick Sabrina into being bad just so she won't stop believing Santa? Never in a million years would I resort to something so low.No we better keep brainstorming because I am definitely not doing that idea.How desperate do you think I am? You are really scraping the bottom of the barrel with that one.No I will clearly not be pursuing that line of action.No way no how.So you want me to sit here and watch the cookies but not eat them? This seems like a trick.He's doing the thing he said he wasn't gonna do! These cookies are for Santa.If anyone eats them he'll be really mad.I need you to guard them.It's a very important job.Well I guess it is about time I start earning my keep around here.I knew I could count on you.Remember no matter what don't eat these delicious home made fresh out of the oven warm gooey chocolate chip delights.I'll leave you here alone with these cookies which are delicious.Okay cookies it's just you and me.Ooh they look so yummy.What would Mommy and Daddy say? Sabrina I'm your Daddy and I say 'Don't eat the cookies!'"" ""Listen to your Father honey he knows what's best."
1," What do you say? Ooh a job like that? You want a fully present presenter to present.And I don't know if I've got the pep in my step to take that show where it needs to go you know? I've got a real pepless step Shep.Okay well let me know because if you don't want to do it we'll probably just post the list of nominees online or something.It's really not that big of a deal.Hey sorry about that.Just got a call from the Oscars. They want me to host  They want you to host the Oscars? Nomination announcement.But I don't think I have it in me right now.Are you kidding? You gotta take that gig. Really?  Mr.Peanutbutter what did Nana Peanutbutter always say? Always take every opportunity that comes your way because opportunities are like sneezes from God and when God sneezes you can't say 'God bless you' to God so instead you have to take the opportunity."
1," What do you What do you think about Sarah Lynn? Oh I don't really think about her all that much.I mean obviously I'm a fan of her early work which both satirized and celebrated youth culture's obsession with sex but I do wonder as a thirdwave feminist if it's even possible for women to reclaim their sexuality in this deeply entrenched patriarchal society or if claiming to do so is just a lie we tell ourselves so we can more comfortably cater to the male gaze. Uh what?  But you know on the other hand I worry that conversations like this one often dismiss her as a mere puppet of the industry  That's my same worry. incapable of engaging  in these discussions herself  Obviously.and infantilization which is itself a product  of the deeply misogynistic  So deep.society we live in.But like I said I don't really think about her all that much.Okay well that is very interesting but I was more asking like what do you think about her living here? Oh right.Well what was your relationship like with her when you were working on the show? It was very good very professional.BoJack where did you go to college?  Don't bother him honey. Oh it's no problem.Honey college is for ugly people who can't tap dance. I want to be an architect. Sweetheart Mommy didn't do what Mommy did to that Star Search producer so that you could be an architect. Aw. All right  take it sleazy everybody. Wait BoJack um what are you doing this weekend? I don't know.I'll probably just go to the amusement park maybe the circus fly a kite on the beach watch the sunset then I'll head back to my place to watch any number of Disney princess movies while eating ice cream straight from the tub.Whoa that sounds like so much fun.Can I come? Yeah like I want to spend my weekend hanging out with a little girl.Good one! You should write for the Shouts and Murmurs.See you Monday! So the makeup they were putting on you was not for the show it was just for the weekend?  Why does that matter?  I'm just trying to understand the story.Do you think it's possible that you inviting Sarah Lynn into your house now is your way of compensating for not No Diane I'm just helping out a friend.I'm not trying to play out some weird sick dad fantasy or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect or even try to retroactively fix my own childhood by recreating someone else's and I'm especially not doing all those things at once! Okay.What happened? Did somebody hurt my precious baby? Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the ? Oh hey BoJack.I told my friends they could tear this wall out to build a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet. Is that cool?  No that's not cool.Oof.Way to harsh the vibe Kissinger.Oh I'm sorry.I didn't realize.I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn could finally be Sarah Lynn but I guess  that's too much man. I always loved that catch phrase.Can your friends at least take the artwork off the wall first? Ooh.I want to say yes but no. Okay good talk. Wha Are you serious? The reason I have called this house meeting is Todd how many times have we been over this? You don't have the authority to call house meetings.Only I can call a house meeting.You can propose a house meeting.All right fine fine fine but the reason I propose  this house meeting  Your proposal has been submitted and is under board review. Proposal denied. BoJack this Sarah Lynn thing is getting out of control okay? She's taking advantage of you.What? No she's not.We have a special relationship.You couldn't possibly understand.Oh my God.Look at what she's done to your house.All right look I mean I stepped on a needle earlier.I think I'm addicted to heroin now so now that's probably gonna be a whole thing.I have to say I agree with Todd.You're not this girl's father and you're not doing her any favors by refusing to set boundaries.Look I played a dad for nine years on TV so I think I know a little bit more about parenting than you two jokers.The kids on Horsin' Around didn't need boundaries.All they needed was some good oldfashioned love.BoJack! This is not a TV show okay? This is real life.Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire! Some good oldfashioned love and I'm gonna give it to her.I'm gonna give it to her so hard.You know I feel like we don't ever hang out.Here you are milady a gin and nutmeg just like you asked.Ugh.Too much nutmeg.Well you know what would taste even better? An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt.Could Vanessa Gecko get you that? Vanessa Gecko got Andrew The Social Network and she has skybox seats at the Staples Center. What do you have?  Well I've got a table at the Comedy Central roast of Gloria Stein Hey Sarah Lynn what say we spend the day together just you and me away from all the haters?  I want to say yes but  Great let's go.It really seems like Some things are forever in this world Don't you know I'm feeling fine together with my girl Daddy's girl She's daddy's girl You know Sarah Lynn I got a feeling  everything's gonna be okay. Uhhuh.Hey did you hear Kazaz got cancer? What? Herb Kazaz has cancer? Yeah in the butt.He's got like six months I think.Well that's horrible.Why would you tell me that now? I don't know.The sun setting over those two hills made me think of a big ass and that made me think of ass cancer and that made me think of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer.You really didn't know? No Herb and I aren't on the best Look I'm trying to have a moment here.I can't Hey I want to give you something. Is this your TV Guide award?  It's the most prestigious award I ever won.I always thought if I ever had kids of my own I'd give it to them one day.I want you to have it.Oh wow.BoJack thanks.You're sweet.Nananana Lalalala Nananana Lalalala  What are you doing?

No way.You are in the prime of your life never looked better.What about as my exgirlfriend?

I'm making breakfast.We had sex last night dummy.Ugh I really got to start putting my phone on airplane mode when I drink.This lady probably thinks I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.I hate her and her stupid impossibletopronounce last name Nagooyagogoogoogooga.You haven't even met her.Give her a chance.Oh you should invite her to the party.What party?

Do you just take those DVDs with you everywhere you go? Linus walked around with a blanket.No one gave him shit for it.How long is that doctor going to take? I have a meeting with another client at 3:00.You have other clients? No I make a living off you sitting on your ass all day.Are your other clients more talented than I am? Your silence speaks volumes.Well BoJack it looks like what you experienced was a mild anxiety attack.Jesus if that's mild I don't want to know what spicy feels like.Too smart for the room? It was a salsa joke people.You've been overstressed.I need you to take it easy.Take it easy are you kidding? He doesn't have a job.He has no real responsibilities.He doesn't do anything but take it easy.Well can you take it even easier? I can try doctor.I can try.This book deal is obviously stressing you out.Will you just call the ghostwriter already? What you want me to call this woman on the phone? Well you just had another anxiety attack.And Entertainment Weekly said I wasn't consistent.Really not even a pity laugh? I did almost die.Ha.I have to check on some other patients.You have other patients? BoJack let's have a party okay? I'll organize the whole thing.You can invite the ghostwriter and have a nice casual conversation in a fun pressurefree environment.Okay fine.We'll have a party.Oh thank God.But we're not getting a cotton candy machine.I can't control myself around those things.I totally hear what you are saying and I will do my best.Seor Horseman I will never forget your generosity today.You have made a powerful ally for life.Mwah.Let's dance! Todd who was that guy? Who are all these people? Oh you know just a variety of folks from all walks of life.Is this a quinceaera? Oh so any party with Mexican teenage girls is a quinceaera? Now who's racist? I find that piata offensive.If you'll excuse me I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present.BoJack! Oh good Lord.Hey Mr.Peanutbutter.Can you believe this the two of us in the same house? Is this a crossover episode? No I'm just kidding around man.Seriously though how are you? Well I've been kind of up and Living the dream huh? Yeah.Hey we'll catch up later all right? I want to talk to you.Erica how are you looking so beautiful? I'm furious.Hey BoJack right?  BoJack Horseman?  Yes.Oh I'm I'm sorry I don't want to mispronounce your name.It's Diane.Oh Diane.Thanks for inviting me to your party.Sorry I haven't really been mingling.I get kind of awkward at parties. Have you tried alcohol?  I don't know.Parties make me anxious in a real broad sense.Like look at that guy.He's having fun.Why haven't I figured it out? What guy? No there's no guy there.I'm just saying like a guy you know? Oh okay yeah.I'm probably just overthinking it because I never got the practice because I didn't get invited to any parties in high school.What am I talking about? You don't care about any of that.Shut up Diane.You're at a party compliment the host.You have a lovely home.Yeah well if you're gonna throw away most of your adult life on some dumb sitcom you might as well get a sweet house out of the deal right? So what are you working on these days? Well mostly I just sit around the house and complain about things.Yeah how's that working out for you? I can't complain so you know.No I will not have sex with you! This girl wants me to have sex with her.No I'm just kidding around.You're a good sport. Ugh you know who that is?  Mr.Peanutbutter? Yeah he was on that show Mr.Peanutbutter's House about that dog who adopted the three human kids.What a dumb idea for a TV show.You people are all right.Who wants an autograph? He's so stupid he doesn't realize how miserable he should be.I envy that.Hey do you know the story of the dad from The Brady Bunch? Do I know his story? If I recall correctly he was bringing up three boys of his own.Right but They were four men living all together but they were all alone.That is profoundly sad.No the story is that the guy who played the dad hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor and he considered it beneath him.Sound familiar? That's not all that was beneath him.Gay joke.Sorry I'm better than that.Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives.You're actually in a really good position now because you can pretty much do anything you want.You're responsible for your own happiness you know?  Good Lord that's depressing. No it's not.I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.Todd! I need help.What would make you happy? Well finishing my memoir I guess.Is that all? I can help you with that.Yeah? I mean would you even want to? You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.You'd probably get sick of me.I don't think that's going to happen. No?  No BoJack.Okay.Well then I guess you're hired but don't put all that stuff about how sad I am in the book.Oh that doesn't count.We weren't on the clock yet.Yeah exactly.You're only my ghostwriter starting nah  Starting now. You got it. BoJack!  Ugh this guy.Hey man wanted to let you know you are out of beer.Oh I see you've met my beautiful girlfriend Diane Nguyen.Whoa whoa whoa wait a second.You drank all my beer?  Also you two are dating?  Yeah. You're dating him?  Yes.This is your boyfriend?  That is correct. Uhhuh. You are going out with you?  Uhhuh.But in a sexual way not just as friends?  That's right. You have seen her naked.Many times yes. You are attracted to this?  Yes.This penis has been inside this vagina. Yep. But in a sexual way.Oh yes.Humph. Ugh. Oh my God.Are you okay? I'm just I'm fine.I'm just I'm really happy for you.Should we get someone or No everything's Oh this is really Wonderful.Oh God.Starting now.Boxer versus raptor.Say when.When.Yeah you'll never guess who's here.Think '90s.No BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around.No I mean he got a little fatter but it's definitely him.He looks really sad.It's hilarious.Get over here now.I told you I don't know where it is.Don't put things in my butt if you want them back.And hold for Princess Carolyn please.Thanks Laura.d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d d Jellicles do and Jelli d BoJack it's your favorite agent.Yeah some agent you couldn't even get me in the room for War Horse.There were like ten horses in that movie.I didn't need to be the warhorse.Listen dummy I want to make sure you're all set for your first day with Diane tomorrow.Is she gonna ask me a bunch of personal questions? The woman we're paying to ghostwrite your memoir? Yeah probably.Okay all right there's no need to get What catty? Are you gonna say catty?  I was not gonna say catty. Oh what were you gonna say? I was gonna say catty because you're a cat.Goodbye BoJack.Laura I know you're listening.You got it right? Laura do not respond to him.Goodbye BoJack.She got it.Oh my God.Take another one.Take another one.Excuse me I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight and I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it.Excuse me? I was actually already in a bad mood but I thought maybe for one night I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself but now because of you and your friends I feel more selfconscious than ever.If we were bothering you so much why didn't you just leave? Because I didn't think of that and now I feel stupid.Look I have a right to be here.No! Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty you're used to getting away with things but I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others and I hate you and you are a horrible person and you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person.You think I'm pretty? Well that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices.What'd you say? I was tweeting about all the weird stuff you do in bed. Good morning. Ah! Why are you here? I slept here.Yeah but why are you still here? Breakfast.That better not be my last Toaster Strudel.No there were three left.Well get out of here.My memoirist is gonna show up soon and I don't need you  What's your name?  Pam.I don't need you Paming up the place when she gets here. Hey BoJack. Ah! Why are you here?  You told me to come at 9:00. That doesn't sound like me.I have your email right here.Diane why don't you come over Tuesday morning at 9:00? Also you should bring this email with you because I might not remember it because I just took a bunch of horse tranquilizers ha ha."
1," What the shit was that? What the shit is this? It's a phone.Well a tiny computer really.I mean amazing what technology can You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir but instead you wrote a story about how you spent six months with me and saw what a big dumb loser I am.Well I realized that the best way to fully capture you warts and all This isn't warts and all.It's just warts.Where's the all? I come off like a total asshole.You come off as complex and deeply troubled but ultimately sympathetic.You might be too close to see that.There's an entire chapter about me eating apple fritters.You did go through that fritter phase.Is this book how you see me? That day we ran errands together I thought that we had a really good time but you just wrote about how I cried because the dry cleaner took my head shot down.You were very emotional.They didn't even replace me with anyone.Now it's just a faded spot where my face used to be.This will actually do wonders for your career.Trust me.I mean you're just a dumb actor who doesn't know anything about books right? What? Remember? From before? Oh I don't think you understand what's happening here.This is not a casual conversation between friends.This is your boss telling his employee that she did a bad job. Try again. What? Start over but do it right this time.Nobody is ever gonna see this.Ugh! Diane? Hey Wayne you still work for BuzzFeed? Um yes.'Cause I got something that's gonna get you a shitton of hearts or digs or smileys or whatever the hell you measure your journalism with.Curses! My evil plan has been defeated but I'll be back.You haven't heard the last of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.Oh no! You shot a laser at me! Oh no! I'm dying.Oh no I'm dead.And so now that we've escaped the evil clutches of the emperor I'm free to assume my natural form an allknowing floating orb of light? True dat.Cut cut.Come on guys this is ridiculous.Is this even a movie anymore? Oh maybe it isn't a movie.Yeah maybe it's an immersive smartphone app or a 21stcentury approach to Yeah or maybe it's just like a feeling you know?  We've got work to do. Yeah yeah. Oh my God this is so good. Oh this is gonna be awesome.Yes! Go Todd.Hello? Are you just gonna leave me like this? Anyone? Ah! Oh good.You're here.Oh hi BoJack.This whole day's been a shit show.The book turned out to be a total hatchet job.The movie's a disaster.But thank God I have one good thing in my life and that's you.BoJack I Please let me say this before I lose my nerve.I spent 50 years roaming the countryside as a wild stallion but I am tired of the rodeo and I'm finally ready to saddle up.BoJack I guess what I'm trying to say is this mustang wants to rest his head in the comforts of your spacious barn.Uh what? I'm in love with you Naomi.BoJack they fired me and replaced me with a ball on a stick.I'm so sorry.But look at the bright side.Now you and I can just hang out and talk about feelings.No but you're not getting it.Boys never get it.BoJack I was in character as Diane and as Diane we had a real connection.But now that I'm off the movie I'm Naomi again and Naomi is not interested in BoJack Horseman.In fact she thinks he's kind of gross.So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts? No.You fell in love with Diane.Naomi what? Goodbye BoJack.Ugh.See? Nothing.What's going on? Why are they packing up? Oh glad you're here.This is exciting.Since we last talked this film has gone through  so many permutations. So many.First we reimagined the whole film as an interactive socialmedia experience.Those are the dumbest words I've ever heard.I know.So we realized it was actually more of a floating art installation but that didn't feel right either.We thought is it a highend perfume? A series of interrelated fortune cookies? A hat that if you turn it upside down it's a boat?  No it's none of those things. Exactly.That's why we finally settled on this.Voil ! What am I looking at? It is a bimonthly curated box of snacks.I don't know what that means.I know.It's confusing.Not the bimonthly that means twice a month the bimonthly that means every other month and each time it's a different box of snacks.This is the future of cinema.You guys finally my story has been told.Okay that's a wrap everyone.Thanks for making this box of snacks a reality.Let's go home.What the hell happened to the movie? Shit there were snacks here the whole time? Not bad. Whoa!  Look I get it.You destroyed my big chance at a comeback as revenge for what I did to your rock opera.Revenge? Oh that would have been such a good idea.Damn it Todd! Look I figured out what you did but I've been trying to put it behind me and do my job.So cutting my part down was not about revenge? No.And making BoJack the villain of your movie was not a coded statement of your feelings about me? No.Oh okay great.Well I'm I'm glad we buried the hatchet and everything's cool.Uh actually you know everything is not cool.You ruined my rock opera by using character actress Margo Martindale to trick me into playing an addictive video game.And saying it all together like that it all sounds kind of ludicrous.But still it was something I cared about and what you did really hurt me.Oh.Well this feels shitty.You sure you don't want to just get some revenge real quick thump me once in the stones and then we'll be even? I got to go.I've got some artisanal popcorns to gauge the mouthfeel of. Hey BoJack. Yeah? You want an apple fritter? Uh sure.Yeah I bet you would.I bet you'd like an apple fritter.Yeah an apple fritter would be great.Why? What What What's happening here? Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book""? No."

The second one? Well if that's true how come you don't have an actor here to play Nixon? Because we couldn't find anyone who could appropriately capture his magic.You know I do a pretty good Nixon.You? No way.Hello I'm Nixon.I can't be at your soccer game but I am your father and I love you very much.Oh my God.He's perfect.We've found our Nixon.I can be ready in five.Uh.Did we get the shot?

I'm listening.A place where people only read headlines lists and pictures.A place where people hate reading so much they hire others to do it for them and don't even pay a living wage.What do you mean like modern reading slaves?

Don't know what that means.Well I was talking to Wayne. Who's Wayne?  I'm Wayne.Wayne's writing an article about me for BuzzFeed.BuzzFeed? What'll they think of next? Fun fact: Wayne is also my exboyfriend.You're funny.Pretty cool eh BoJack? Diane's writing a book about you Wayne's writing an article about me.We're the same! How could you think that that's the same? My book will be in libraries for hundreds of years.Your BuzzFeed article will be crammed between an animated GIF of a cat falling asleep and a list of fun facts about Legally Blonde. Ha! Classic Zoe. I still don't know what that means.Well are you familiar with Mr.Peanutbutter's House? Do you mean his sitcom that coincidentally had the exact same premise as my sitcom? Not the exact same.Mr.Peanutbutter's House featured a pair of twins Zoe and Zelda.Zelda was the sunny funloving extrovert. Look at my pumpkin Mr.Peanutbutter. Pretty smile Zellybelly.Aww Whereas Zoe was the smart cynical introvert.My pumpkin's throwing up because Halloween encourages excessive consumption of refined sugar at a time when obesity rates are sky high.Plus Halloween costumes are a gateway to casual racism.Why don't I keep the knife Zobo?

No Zooey's a Zelda.Emily's the Zoe.What a crazy world. So which one are you BoJack?

[MOANS]  Well  Because mine was awful.I mean truly one for the books.Because I'm a good guy trying to do the right thing.First I go for my breakfast Pinkberry which I had earned because I had good intentions for today they're out of my favorite toppings! So I go across the street to Menchie's like some kind of hobo.[CHUCKLES] Mmhmm.At Menchie's the stupid teen that worked there raised her eyebrows at me.You kidding me? You're trying to judge me? You have very uneven eyebrows and you work at a Menchie's."
1," Yeah do you pick up bodies? Is that a service you provide? Corpse removal? Hey BoJack you ever meet any Boston celebrities? Well one time at Bristol Farms Ben Affleck and I did reach for the same bunch of grapes.Oh he eats grapes just like us? Hey Ma Ben Affleck eats grapes! He don't eat grapes! BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes.He was graping it up with the Daredevil himself. This is the greatest day of my life. Oh! Hey I don't suppose you boys would have any interest in maybe playing some touch football later? Are you kidding? Touch football with a star like you? That would be mad wicked pisser.Ooh you know what else we got to do? We got to watch the Cryane video.Ooh that sounds good.What's that?  No we don't need to revisit that. When Deedee was 16 we made up a secret pen pal for her named Leo.Guys I really would rather not discuss it.We all took turns writing her letters pretending to be this sensitive boy from Cambridge.It was wicked messed up.Oh Diane we're two misunderstood souls."
1," Yeah I know.I'm acting.Great.Now I gotta start all over.Settle in folks.We could be here a while. Ow! Ooh. Ah Princess Carolyn.So good of you to join us eventually.Sorry I'm late.I had the worst morning.You know who had an even the worster"" morning?  Ronnie Bonito."
1," Yeah I would say that I'm not such a fan of that one.Look all publicity is good publicity.That guy who killed all those teachers and ate their fingers? He just got married in jail and when this book comes out you could be that guy.Don't you get it? This is my last chance to make people love me again.If this goes out everybody's gonna see the real me.Now I spend a lot of time with the real me and believe me nobody's gonna love that guy. Okay. Now if you'll excuse me I need to go take a shower so I can't tell if I'm crying or not.All right let's get to work.for the truly modern man.Ha.No.There you are Verdana.Thought you could hide at the end of the alphabet did ya? Comic Sans you drunk go home.Okay focus BoJack focus.Here comes the focus.Well this can't be that hard.BoJack often felt the need to impress me with material items.You can see from the teeny tiny brush strokes that this is very expensive.The color is um This one they don't even have a name for that's how exclusive it is and this I wondered where this came from.There were two obvious suspects.His mother Beatrice heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cubes fortune and used to certain comforts and his workingclass father Butterscotch Horseman who struggled and often failed to provide those comforts.Or maybe it was something even Puuuhhhh! Puuuhhhh!  Hey Todd Todd!  What? What?  Todd! Todd!  What? What? Eyeballs here Look at me.Look at me! I need to work.I can't afford to be distracted. Don't distract me. Fine.Jesus Todd!  Read louder much?  Sorry.Sure just drop Toaster Strudel crumbs all over the floor why don't you? Guess I'll just clean them up myself like always.I can't work like this.Come on come on come on pick it up you dumb vacuum.I do not have time for this.I need to write.What the Come on! Seriously? You cannot be seriou God why are you keeping me from writing? My parents loved me so much it was crazy.I remember one Sunday afternoon my mother said Your father and I want to spend quality family time together."
1," Yeah sounds good.You know with my knack for coming up with plans and your ability to hear them without contributing more than three words at a time we make a pretty good team don't we Todd?  You said it. See? Beloved character actress Margo Martindale is in police custody tonight for her role in a failed bank robbery.Margo Martindale? But first pizza for breakfast? The answer might surprise you.I know her but how? Wait.She was at the convenience store the night I bought that video game and ruined my rock opera.She's the one who asked me to hand her that tape from the 10 bin.That means Margo Martindale likes tapes! And a tape is something you listen to but tape is also a sticky thing you can use to seal boxes.Boxes is what cereal comes in.What does it all mean? Am I just grasping at straws? Wait.Straws That's it.Straws are used to drink soda or water and plants need water.And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant at the bank and the convenience store which means Ugh! BoJack hired Margo Martindale to make me find that video game so he could kill my rock opera! Aw dude. Rise and shine Todd. I didn't sleep.Well we're down to the wire but we still got one more day to figure out how to stop this wedding and I can't afford to waste one second so let's get Oh shit.Forgot about jury duty.Damn you Tuesday BoJack. And so you saw the defendant. Yes.That man the defendant You saw him? Come on come on come on.Hurry up. That's correct. The defendant was seen by you.Sweet Jesus.Some of us have weddings to ruin.Yes.No further questions Your Honor.I'm sorry.I misspoke.A lot of further questions.The jury finds the defendant not guilty on all charges.We did the right thing today BoJack.But you know who the real winner is?  Justice. Mr.Peanutbutter.BoJack.There's my superstar. How are you?  Amazing! This has been the role of a lifetime.I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc and when I get there I'm gonna find the meanest hardest queen bitch of the yard and I'm going to bite her finger off.That'll show everyone I'm crazy and you don't mess with crazy.Plus free finger.Oh here I am blabbering on about my plans.Did you ever stop that wedding? It's actually happening right now.I ran out of time.I never understood why it was so important to keep those two apart.I was just trying to be a good friend in my own shitty assbackwards way.Diane deserves the best.She's smart and kind and beautiful and it's gonna be mostly synonyms from here on if I keep going and I'm in love with her.Tell her that BoJack.You don't need kooky schemes or nutty capers.Just go to her and speak from your heart.Then find the biggest person at the wedding and bite his finger off! You're right partly.I've gotta tell her how I feel.Okay I'm gonna do it.Good luck with your finger thing.Todd thank God you're here! Did I miss it? Is it too late? Dude.I'm done with this.No.No.Mr.Peanutbutter's been nice to me.Mr.Peanutbutter is nice to everybody.That's what makes him so stupid.No I'm stupid.But even I know that the only reason you're doing this is because you're in love with Diane.Yes that's right.And I'm here to finally tell her how I feel.BoJack she knows how you feel.How? I barely just realized Hey man she made her choice.Look around.This day is not about you okay? So maybe you should just stop trying to mess with other people's lives.I never thought I wanted to get married.It's so weird this idea of dedicating yourself to something for the rest of your life.Like how could you know right? But then I realized it's okay to not know everything.And some things take a leap of faith.Mr.Peanutbutter I want to take that leap with you.By the power vested in me by one of those dumb websites I now pronounce you married.Go ahead.Kiss you lovesick dummies.Ow! Mmmyeah I used to think maybe Hey Todd.Todd.Thanks for hearing me out the other night.I'm really glad I went through with this.This is the happiest day of my life.Always happy to be of service.Oh and um I got you something.Todd Chavez? Hey.That name's my name.What's PB Livin'""? My film production company."
1," Yeah that's the sound a stick makes when you hit it with your car.Fine.I'll see if the stick's okay.Hey what are you doing here in the middle of the road? Are you crazy? BoJack we just hit a deer.We have to get him to a hospital.He's fine.He's in the woods.You know you hit a deer and they limp off to the woods to continue living their lives.What are you doing? I'm going to find him and I'm going to help him.If you wanna go for a walk in the woods at night go crazy but I'm not going anywhere.Okay knock yourself out.I'll wait here just me and my tunes.It's A Prairie Home Companion  Oh no. marathon  for the next 72 hours  Oh God. commercialfree  No thank you. on every single channel  What?!

Footprints 400 yards ahead. How can you see that far in the dark?  I'm an owl.Oh right.Okay now you're just showing off.Are you okay? Ow.Stay back! There's more pinecones where that came from. Let us take you to the hospital. I can't go back to no hospital.This is the fourth time I've been hit this year.Maybe you shouldn't wear camouflage track suits.I don't have health care.I didn't pay my bills so I'm in arrears.A deer in arrears.Ha ha.What's that? She can't hear you.She's got a deer in her ears.Look pal I'll pay the bill just Just let us get you to a damn hospital. I don't know. I know you've been hurt and I know you're afraid.We're all afraid.But you have to trust us.It's gonna be okay.Not standing in the middle of the road will also help in the future. You're not gonna hurt me again?  I am not going to hurt you.Okay.Starting now. They said he's gonna be okay. Oh great.Great. Wanna hear another joke?  Well is it a joke or is it a story? I'll listen to another story if you stop calling them jokes.So there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well.One day the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend.She reads them and like loves how silly they are.You know the drama of young romance.So on a whim she sends the letters to her exboyfriend thinking he might find them funny too.Well okay that night she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his shit.They get in a huge fight about it.He's all Why would you send your ex the old love letters? He'll think you're still in love with him!"" And she's just like ""Relax Brandon!""  Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?  Yeah that's the new boyfriend."
1," You always could play the fool BoJack.We have to have this conversation now on the way to Dad's funeral? [SIGHS] There was so much more I wanted to say to him.Well you can forget it now.[LAUGHS] [OLIVIA] And since you saw me naked that means I get to see you naked! [THE HORSE] Something tells me I'm gonna regret this. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING]  [GROANS] Out of the way hag you're blocking the screen.Uhhuh.I know this must be painful for you.Not painful boring.This place sucks.If I'm not getting credit for coming what's the point? If only there was some way for her to connect the BoJack from the show with the BoJack who visits her every week. Yeah too bad we can't.Or can we?  Can we what? Put on a live episode of Horsin' Around in the nursing home. Good thinking Hollyhock. Uh We'll do a Horsin' Around here at the home.She'll love it because it's her son BoJack. Okay  Then after the show I'll come out and say hello.And she'll say BoJack? Is that you?"" When her eyes spark with recognition I'm gonna sit down next to her I'm gonna squeeze her hand and get real close and say  ""Fuck you Mom."
1," You can stay another week.Tasha our 'anaconda don't want none."
1," You don't have to keep Anyway I'm pretty much in love with you.Thanks.I love you.By which I mean you're terrible.I should get back to this stupid rehearsal dinner.Todd it was really great to see you.Wait did you say there's a wedding?  I said rehearsal dinner"" but  Whoa! We gotta crash that."
1," You don't think this is incredibly disrespectful to the women who actually get abortions? Not if we do it tasteful.Diane this is what the client wants.Stop making it about you.I'm not making it about me. I am so tired of you creating problems. I'm not I'm sorry you're so fertile and in a sexually active loving relationship and now you don't want a family. I'm sure that's really hard for you. What?

Oh um You know I think I Googled the wrong guy. Did you think I was Bo Jackson?  This idea I know you're going to like.You know that car wash on Alvarado? They need someone to dress up like a gorilla and spin a sign.Why would I do that? Anything that gets your face out there right? How does it get my face out there dressed like a gorilla? Maybe that one's a dud but hey you think Lou Bega knocked it out of the park with Mambo Number One""? No but he kept at it."
1," You get that? Long face.Horses have long faces.I am a horse my face is long.You get it right? Good good.What about the Rock Hudson stuff? Felt like that flew over your heads.Did you get that? Keep this up and the only thing we're gonna get is our money back! Okay okay it wasn't that funny.Maybe you didn't get it.Uh hey guys guys  Hey let me buy you a drink. Get cancer jerk wad.You've got some good material you really do.The Gorbachev stuff it's killer.But you gotta stop asking people if they get things. But then who do I know if they got it?

1," You go to counseling and remember why you fell in love with her in the first place and then blah blah it's a whole thing.We've been sleeping together for three months. We're about to start a company together. None of that has to change.I am definitely going to divorce her probably it's just Ugh.It's hard to explain to someone who's never been married. Listen this is  Oh!

1," You know a lot of people go their whole lives and they never give a damn.But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.That was beautiful.You clearly had a special relationship.We were gonna sprinkle Herb over the ocean but his resting place should be someplace meaningful don't you think? Why don't you take this up to Ottawa and spread his ashes there.And make sure you take a video and I'll email blast it to everyone here.So we can always remember your great friendship.Everybody stop!

1, You know what the doctor says?  Don't do that.
1," You know what this is a really good conversation and I definitely want to keep having it but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing so maybe we could put a pin in this thorough deconstruction of my past so I can put that other thing to bed before it spirals out of con I had dibs!  My dibs were on those muffins!  Your dibs were void! I spent a year in Afghanistan making America safer and this is the thanks I get? Really you specifically made America safer? Well BoJack surely even you would agree that the troops are heroes.I don't agree to that.Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically.I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.Most people are jerks already and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.What? Did you just say you think the troops are jerks? Oh you took that the bad way didn't you? I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.No no no. The troops are jerks?  Oh God.Most people are jerks already and it's not like giving a jerk a gun Hello? Princess Carolyn needs to talk to you immediately.Great put her on.She's actually just getting out of a meeting. Can you hold for a sec?  You called me.d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d Ugh.d Jellicles would And Jellicles can d  BoJack. Ah! I'm gonna level with you honey.This whole you hating the troops thing is not great.I don't hate the troops.I just hate one specific troop.I don't even hate him really.I just think that he's wrong about the muffins.I know BoJack just like always you're right and everyone else is wrong.But if you don't swallow your pride this is never gonna let up. I know you're stubborn  I'm not stubborn. I'm proud. That's kind of the same thing.No it's an important distinction.Okay fine.You're not stubborn.But I'm about to tell you something very important so I want you to listen carefully.I'm getting another call.I'm gonna have to put you on hold.d When you're walking alone d d Because Jellicles are And Jellicles do d It is now day three of the great BoJack jerkoff Really? That's the name we came up with for this? Who came up with that? Was it Randy? Did Randy come up with that? Anyway the former television actor who hates our troops has not left his home since his controversial remarks on Monday about how he hates the troops.BoJack Horseman makes me sick.He voiced his opinion even though it was unpopular and that's the most cowardly thing a person can do.After we made love he covered himself in sheets like an Arab.At this very moment Congress is voting on a major education bill that could completely restructure the Joan I'm sorry to interrupt you but we've got some big news on the BoJack Horseman front.It appears that BoJack's Lexus is coming out of the garage.This is very big news indeed.Any comment on BoJack's controversial remarks this week? Uh nope.So where are we going? Don't worry I've got a plan.Whoa! Jeez.Ayako hey I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto._ _ _ _ _ Hey I meant I was rich because I have friends like George Bailey._ _ _ Hello? Well I'm out of ideas.We can hide out at my place while we make a plan.Yeah great just get me away from the cameras.Do we really need to be filming this? It's for my reality show.You never know when gold's gonna strike.Yeah gold doesn't strike.That's why you never know.BoJack be nice.Just pretend they're not there.Okay.Well I Could you speak up please?  I'd like to  Whoa whoa whoa whoa.That's too loud.I want to fix this as quickly as possible.I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore even though I was definitely right.I just want my privacy back so I can finish writing my tellall memoir so everyone will pay attention to me again.I've already reached out to the McBeal camp.He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize and present to him a box of muffins as a symbol of your great admiration for the American military and everything they do.But I ate the muffins.I know.We got another box.It's in the cupboard.Oh you were saving those? I ate those too.We've been here for ten minutes! It's okay we'll get more muffins.I'll get the muffins and they're on me.I just found out I got I'm helping! Hooray! So where are we gonna do this? Do I have to go on MSNBSea? No we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.Oh why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly? You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly if there's no jelly.It's a pun.It's not a pun if it only works one way.Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now? Look I know tempers are high but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality show which we all agree is really clever.We can edit this to make me look smart right? d Yeah d  d Peanutbutter d  d Come on d How's this look? Looks good?  Okay. Marker sound speed.Well here I am hanging out with my good friend BoJack Horseman enjoying each other's company as we often do.Yes this is all very authentic and natural.Oh someone's at the door! I will see who it is.Wow this is a surprise.Neal McBeal.Hello sir.Thank you for inviting me into your home.It is lovely.BoJack is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal? Ahem.Oh yeah Todd? What the hell is this? I tried to buy the muffins but my bank card got declined for some reason.But don't worry I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.I'm sorry? Yeah they're just giving them away behind InNOut.Why does anybody pay for anything? Ow.Uh Neal as a token of my admiration please accept this bag of stale hamburger buns. What?  Yes hamburger buns.It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash sadly far too often.I'm listening.We send our muffins overseas and they come back as stale hamburger buns but that doesn't mean we should love them any less because in their own way aren't stale hamburger buns just as good? Mmm.American made.So what you're saying is you think I'm a hero.Well I don't know if I Say it BoJack.Say I'm a hero.You're a hero.The troops are all heroes every single one.Great.And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns.Okay you can let go of the bag now.Also I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.Yeah me neither.I think we're in agreement here.Furthermore I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.Okay.And finally I don't Hey look Mr.Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.Guys guys where am I? Can someone tell me where I am? Hey where'd he get that bucket from? Who gave him a bucket? Uh actually I had another point I wanted to make.Yeah but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? Come on.Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Hey can anyone find a handle? Oh thank you my friend.You're a real hero.Unbelievable.What's your name young lady? Well my real name's Angela but my friends call me Jelly.What? Oh my God did we get that? Please tell me we got that.You want a dayold hamburger bun? I'm all right.How'd it go down there? You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe.No one ever wants to hear the truth.I want to hear the truth.I don't know if you want to tell it though.What do you mean? Mr.Normal Childhood Mr.Uneventful Father? Look I can write you the standard emptycalorie celebrity tellsome if that's what you're looking for but I thought you might want more than that.I do.Well then you're going to have to open up and give me something real.What you think I can't open up? Well I don't know if you can or not.You certainly haven't.Okay from now on full truth warts and all.You're not gonna make me look like an asshole are you? I don't know are you an asshole? Okay full truth here we go.You want to know about my parents? They drank a lot.My father was a failed novelist.My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune and my dad resented her for it.He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records.He made me build my own tree house and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty Christian nails I used screws which he called fancy Jew nails.Like I said totally normal.Prickly Muffin Who wants chocolate chip pancakes?

0,1  AGENT FUNCTION  AGENT PROGRAM  Actions  Agents interact with environments through sensors and actuators.
0,1  AGENTS AND E NVIRONMENTS  ENVIRONMENT SENSOR ACTUATOR  PERCEPT PERCEPT SEQUENCE  An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.
0,1  RATIONALITY  We call ourselves Homo sapiensman the wisebecause our intelligence is so important to us.
0,1  Some definitions of artificial intelligence organized into four categories.
0,1  The simplest agents discussed in Chapter 2 were the reflex agents which base their actions on a direct mapping from states to actions.
0,1 A simple problem-solving agent.
0,1 Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach TURING TEST  The Turing Test proposed by Alan Turing (1950) was designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence.
0,1 Agent programs The agent programs that we design in this book all have the same skeleton: they take the current percept as input from the sensors and return an action to the actuators.
0,1 Define in your own words: (a) intelligence (b) artificial intelligence (c) agent (d) rationality (e) logical reasoning.
0,1 describes the complete-state formulation and Chapter 6 gives a simple algorithm that solves even the million-queens problem with ease.
0,1 If the agent uses some randomization to choose its actions then we would have to try each sequence many times to identify the probability of each action.
0,1 In other words the agent will not know which of its possible actions is best because it does not yet know enough about the state that results from taking each action.
0,1 Infrastructure for search algorithms Search algorithms require a data structure to keep track of the search tree that is being constructed.
0,1 McCarthy defined the high-level language Lisp which was to become the dominant AI programming language for the next 30 years.
0,1 Philosophy      Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
0,1 Rationality What is rational at any given time depends on four things:     DEFINITION OF A RATIONAL AGENT  37  The performance measure that defines the criterion of success.
0,1 Specifying the task environment  PEAS  In our discussion of the rationality of the simple vacuum-cleaner agent we had to specify the performance measure the environment and the agents actuators and sensors.
0,1 Suppose that the performance measure is concerned with just the first T time steps of the environment and ignores everything thereafter.
0,1 The gestation of artificial intelligence (1943_1955)  HEBBIAN LEARNING  The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943).
0,1 The table is of course an external characterization of the agent.
0,1 Toy problems The first example we examine is the vacuum world first introduced in Chapter 2.
0,1 we see eight definitions of AI laid out along two dimensions.
0,1 Well-defined problems and solutions PROBLEM INITIAL STATE  A problem can be defined formally by five components:  The initial state that the agent starts in.
0,1 What Is AI?
1,1 Whoa.
0,10  Is AI a science or is it engineering?

0,AI currently encompasses a huge variety of subfields ranging from the general (learning and perception) to the specific such as playing chess proving mathematical theorems writing poetry driving a car on a crowded street and diagnosing diseases.
0,AI is one of the newest fields in science and engineering.
0,AI is relevant to any intellectual task; it is truly a universal field.
0,AI is the only one of these fields that is clearly a branch of computer science (although operations research does share an emphasis on computer simulations) and AI is the only field to attempt to build machines that will function autonomously in complex changing environments.

1,First I gotta get a selfie with this thing.
0,First it is more general than the laws of thought approach because correct inference is just one of several possible mechanisms for achieving rationality.
0,First it is not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation particularly when the knowledge is less than 100% certain.
0,First it would not be rational to cross the road given this uninformative percept sequence: the risk of accident from crossing without looking is too great.

1,First we gotta get the best lockpick in the city.
0,First we have described how an entity may be viewed as an agent but we have not explained which entities must be viewed as agents.
0,First we need some information about how the world evolves independently of the agentfor example that an overtaking car generally will be closer behind than it was a moment ago.
0,First we need to say what the performance measure is what is known about the environment and what sensors and actuators the agent has.
0,First what is the performance measure to which we would like our automated driver to aspire?
0,First when there are conflicting goals only some of which can be achieved (for example speed and safety) the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.

1,For all those hardtocatch bagels.
0,For artificial intelligence to succeed we need two things: intelligence and an artifact.
0,For d = 20 this means about a trillion nodes but only about 800 distinct states.
0,For each node n of the tree we have a structure that contains four components:      n.
0,For every typo or confusing explanation that remains in the book rest assured that Julie has fixed at least five.
0,For example a chess program could receive a percept indicating that it has checkmated its opponent but it needs a performance standard to know that this is a good thing; the percept itself does not say so.
0,For example a chess tournament consists of a sequence of games; each game is an episode because (by and large) the contribution of the moves in one game to the agents overall performance is not affected by the moves in its previous game.
0,For example a robot designed to inspect parts as they come by on a conveyor belt can make use of a number of simplifying assumptions: that the lighting is always just so that the only thing on the conveyor belt will be parts of a kind that it knows about and that only two actions (accept or reject) are possible.
0,For example a vacuum-cleaning agent that learns to foresee where and when additional dirt will appear will do better than one that does not.
0,For example after the taxi makes a quick left turn across three lanes of traffic the critic observes the shocking language used by other drivers.
0,For example Allen Newell and Herbert Simon who developed GPS the General Problem Solver (Newell and Simon 1961) were not content merely to have their program solve problems correctly.
0,For example an agent solving a crossword puzzle by itself is clearly in a single-agent environment whereas an agent playing chess is in a twoagent environment.
0,For example an agent that has to spot defective parts on an assembly line bases each decision on the current part regardless of previous decisions; moreover the current decision doesnt affect whether the next part is  44  STATIC DYNAMIC  SEMIDYNAMIC  DISCRETE CONTINUOUS  KNOWN UNKNOWN  Chapter  2.
0,For example an automated taxi may not be able to see around the large truck that has stopped in front of it and can only guess about what may be causing the hold-up.
0,For example at a road junction the taxi can turn left turn right or go straight on.
0,For example from the state In(Arad ) the applicable actions are {Go(Sibiu) Go(Timisoara ) Go(Zerind )}.
0,For example he showed how some simple axioms would enable the program to generate a plan to drive to the airport.
0,For example if an agent does not look both ways before crossing a busy road then its percept sequence will not tell it that there is a large truck approaching at high speed.
0,For example if the taxi exerts a certain braking pressure when driving on a wet road then it will soon find out how much deceleration is actually achieved.
0,For example if the vacuum agent perceives [Clean] it might flip a coin to choose between Left and Right.
0,For example if we formulate the 8-queens problem (page 71) so that a queen can be placed in any column then each state with n queens can be reached by n!
0,For example in chess the goal is to reach a state called checkmate where the opponents king is under attack and cant escape.
0,For example in chess the opponent entity B is trying to maximize its performance measure which by the rules of chess minimizes agent As performance measure.
0,For example many action sequences will get the taxi to its destination (thereby achieving the goal) but some are quicker safer more reliable or cheaper than others.
0,For example Minsky and Paperts book Perceptrons (1969) proved that although perceptrons (a simple form of neural network) could be shown to learn anything they were capable of representing they could represent very little.
0,For example no machine can tell in general whether a given program will return an answer on a given input or run forever.
0,For example once all the dirt is cleaned up the agent will oscillate needlessly back and forth; if the performance measure includes a penalty of one point for each movement left or right the agent will fare poorly.
0,For example one point could be awarded for each clean square at each time step (perhaps with a penalty for electricity consumed and noise generated).
0,For example recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action that is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.
0,For example suppose the taxi-driving agent receives no tips from passengers who have been thoroughly shaken up during the trip.
0,For example the braking rule given earlier assumes that the condition car-in-front-is-braking can be determined from the current percepta single frame of video.
0,For example the chess environment has a finite number of distinct states (excluding the clock).
0,For example the following rule is used to recognize a ketone (C=O) subgroup (which weighs 28): if there are two peaks at x1 and x2 such that (a) x1 + x2 = M + 28 (M is the mass of the whole molecule);  Section 1.
0,For example the initial state for our agent in Romania might be described as In(Arad ).
0,For example the mass spectrum might contain a peak at m = 15 corresponding to the mass of a methyl (CH3 ) fragment.
0,For example the notion of clean floor in the preceding paragraph is based on average cleanliness over time.
0,For example the vacuum agent whose agent function is tabulated in Figure 2.
0,For example the vacuum environment generator initializes the dirt pattern and agent location randomly.
0,For example to evaluate a taxi driver in simulated traffic we would want to run many simulations with different traffic lighting and weather conditions.
0,For example under less than ideal conditions the agent might plan to drive from Arad to Sibiu and then to Rimnicu Vilcea but may also need to have a contingency plan in case it arrives by accident in Zerind instead of Sibiu.
0,For example we can reach 5 from 4 as follows:    
0,For example we could drive with the radio on between Sibiu and Rimnicu Vilcea and then switch it off for the rest of the trip.
0,For example we describe the part-picking robot as episodic because it normally considers each part in isolation.
0,For example we might notice that a large truck ahead of us is reversing into the driveway of a dairy farm but a cow has got loose and is blocking the trucks path.
0,For good you mean? Maybe you should.
0,For his collection.
0,For kicks? Yeah.
0,For many purposes we need to understand the world as having things in it that are related to each other not just variables with values.
1,For most it's when they get married settle into a routine.
0,For most of the book however we will adopt the working hypothesis that perfect rationality is a good starting point for analysis.
0,For now 1  We are assuming that most readers are in the same position and can easily imagine themselves to be as clueless as our agent.
0,For now let us assume that the agent will consider actions at the level of driving from one major town to another.
0,For now we note that programming a computer to pass a rigorously applied test provides plenty to work on.
1,For once I have a problem I need your help.
1,For once I would just love to phone it in and play a twodimensional girl in a rom com with no inner life of her own.
1,For one thing that'd eat up a lot of oxygen and who knows how much we have down here.
0,For small economies the situation is much more like a game: the actions of one player can significantly affect the utility of another (either positively or negatively).
0,For other driving tasks such as changing lanes the agent needs to keep track of where the other cars are if it cant see them all at once.
0,For posterity.
0,For Romania this time.
0,For security that's why I carry it.
0,For some environments such as chess and poker it is quite easy to supply the agent with full knowledge of the rules but it is nonetheless interesting to consider how an agent might learn to play these games without such knowledge.
0,For the acronymically minded we call this the PEAS (Performance Environment Actuators Sensors) description.
0,For the agent driving in Romania its reasonable to suppose that each city on the map has a sign indicating its presence to arriving drivers.
0,For the agent trying to get to Bucharest time is of the essence so the cost of a path might be its length in kilometers.
1,For the baby.
1,For the baby.
0,For the braking problem the internal state is not too extensive just the previous frame from the camera allowing the agent to detect when two red lights at the edge of the vehicle go on or off simultaneously.
0,For the first time I felt safe.
0,For the first time in my life making love felt natural.
0,For the most part economists did not address the third question listed above namely how to make rational decisions when payoffs from actions are not immediate but instead result from several actions taken in sequence.
0,For the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students and colleagues at MIT CMU Stanford and IBM.
0,For the purposes of solving this problem it may suffice to reduce the state of world to just the name of the city we are ina single atom of knowledge; a black box whose only discernible property is that of being identical to or different from another black box.
0,For the record where was she last night? My wife? You're joking.
0,For the reflex agent on the other hand we would have to rewrite many condition_action rules.
1,For the rest of our lives.

0,Funny.
0,Further examples appear in Exercise 2.
0,Furthermore because the cost of an action (a flight segment) may depend on previous segments their fare bases and their status as domestic or international the state must record extra information about these historical aspects.
0,Furthermore in two kinds of cases goals are inadequate but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions.
0,Furthermore medical diagnosis is episodic if one conceives of the task as selecting a diagnosis given a list of symptoms; the problem is sequential if the task can include proposing a series of tests evaluating progress over the course of treatment and so on.

0, but What kind of performance element will my agent need to do this once it has learned how?
0, Despite the increasing speed of computers careful use of resources will characterize intelligent systems.
0, era.
0, Given an agent design learning mechanisms can be constructed to improve every part of the agent.
0, In fact what matters is not the distinction between real and artificial environments but the complexity of the relationship among the behavior of the agent the percept sequence generated by the environment and the performance measure.
0, In the reflex agent designs this information is not explicitly represented because the built-in rules map directly from  Section 2.
0, It takes about a thousand pages to begin to answer that question properly but here we want to draw the readers attention to some basic distinctions among the various ways that the components can represent the environment that the agent inhabits.
0, Its true that such agents would be intelligent but its not simple.
1,O Okay.
0, one might say What else could it be?

0,Obviously doing the right thing is better than doing the wrong thing but what does it mean to do the right thing?
0,Obviously if the environment is unknown the agent will have to learn how it works in order to make good decisions.
1,Obviously it has no effect on the polls because the only thing voters care about is stupid bullshit so knock yourself out.
1,Obviously it's great to see Mr.
0,Obviously some of these goals conflict so tradeoffs will be required.

0,Obviously the more restricted the environment the easier the design problem.
0,Obviously the program we choose has to be one that is appropriate for the architecture.
0,Obviously the second path is redundantits just a worse way to get to the same state.
0,Obviously there is not one fixed performance measure for all tasks and agents; typically a designer will devise one appropriate to the circumstances.
