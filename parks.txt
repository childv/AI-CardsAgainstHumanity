Giddyup! Giddyup! Meet Leslie Knope.
I am the pants queen! Leslie loves whipped cream, dancing with friends, and working hard for the Parks Department of Pawnee, Indiana.
Cut it out, Tom.
- It never gets old.
She also loves her coworkers at City Hall.
Ron Swanson.
Tom Haverford.
Tommy Timberlake.
April Ludgate.
My mom is Puerto Rican.
That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
And Andy Dwyer.
Nailed it.
April and Andy like each other.
But when Andy accidentally kissed his ex-girlfriend, Ann Perkins, April left.
Wait.
April! And he hasn't seen her since.
In the midst of all this love, two black hats rode into town.
Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
I believe I am that human being.
And they brought with them some disturbing news.
Effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice.
What will Leslie do next? Will April and Andy make up and make out? Find out this season on Parks and Recreation.
Starting right now.
Ron.
We're back.
Bully.
The bankrupt government of Pawnee has been shut down all summer, so it's been three months of no work, no meetings, no memos, no late nights, nothing.
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Rounding up the team, so exciting.
I have goose bumps.
Feel.
And that's why they call me Prince Charming.
Because I always find the glass slipper for my Cinderella.
These are way too tight.
Well, the real Cinderella didn't have hippo feet.
Tom, we're back.
Jeremy! Suck it! By the way, I've been giving away free sports bras to the girls at Hot Dog on a Stick.
Look, we can dance all day, but it's time to step up.
Are you buying 4,000 rubber nipples from me or not? D, you have a visitor.
We back? We're back.
All right.
Jerry.
Oh, my gosh.
Look who's here.
Leslie.
The nightmare's over, Jerry.
We're going back to work.
You're not going to need this anymore.
Come on! I called shotgun.
Everybody heard me.
Well, I am usually not one for speeches.
So, goodbye.
Break's over, mofos.
Okay.
Here's the situation.
We are operating on a shoestring budget.
Park services have been slashed.
But we are all still here.
And we have a job to do.
Make the world's biggest pizza.
No, make this town fun for the people who live here.
Fine, but after that, the pizza is our top priority.
No, it's not.
We're getting pizza? April, hey, it's me, Andy Dwyer.
This is like the 200th message I've left you, without a response.
So, if you're trying to tell me something, I do not know what it is because you won't call me back.
It is truly great to see all of you, huh? It's great news! Okay.
I have to run.
Ben.
The bad news, which I get to deliver, is this.
Your only work for the time being will be existing park maintenance.
So, that just means that we're in maintenance mode.
Yeah! Jerry! Okay.
See, I've spent the last few months brainstorming.
And I have some really great ideas and I put them in my idea binders.
I mean, they're color coded, for God's sake.
Okay.
Actually, yeah.
There is one thing that you will be doing.
Apparently, in Indiana, if you don't provide a basketball league, people get very upset.
And quite frankly, throw things at you and call you names.
Like Turd-boy.
Whatever.
The point is I reinstated youth basketball.
Okay? It says here you only have money for two teams? Yeah.
They're going to develop a great rivalry.
Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys into men, from men into gladiators, and from gladiators into Swansons.
Behold! The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.
I've been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years.
It's a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement.
Categories include Capitalism.
God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor.
Crying.
Acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.
Rage.
Poise.
Property rights.
Fish, for sport only, not for meat.
Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
Haircuts.
There are three acceptable haircuts.
High and tight.
Crew cut.
Buzz cut.
Are the scissors broken in your house, son? So, are you happy to be back at work? Well, our budget's been slashed to zero.
I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.
Request denied.
We literally can't buy I'm so sorry.
No.
I mean, look, when we were kids, the Parks Department would do these big projects.
Winter Jamboree, the Harvest Festival.
It's like they don't have faith in us anymore.
I'm not a paper pusher, Ann.
I need to be out in the streets, planting trees and cracking skulls.
Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins.
How are my two favorite people in this entire town? Not good, Chris.
There was a whole line of people in my office complaining that all their programs have been slashed.
Yeah, I know, it's terrible.
Is there anything we can do about that? No.
Damn! Sorry, Leslie.
Ann, could I talk to you for a minute? So, how's it going? Save it.
Okay? I know you don't have faith in me and my department, and that's fine.
But don't expect me to sit here and chitchat with you.
All right.
Fair enough.
Go the other way.
But I'm just going to that All right, I'II Look.
I'm very flattered.
But again, I don't think I should go out with you.
Can I ask you why not? Because I thought we had a great time the night you got drunk and kissed me.
And you did use your tongue.
I just don't think I'm in a place to go out with anyone right now.
Okay.
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me, Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope.
Yes.
Did he ask you out again? He did.
He did.
He is nothing if not persistent.
And hot.
He's very He's pretty hot.
Yeah, he's hot.
But he's intense.
But he's really, really hot.
But he's your boss.
Oh, my God.
I just thought of an idea of how we can save the Parks Department.
Great.
Let me ask you one question.
Would you be cool doing things that a prostitute does? Minus the money? Definitely yes, then.
Thanks, Ann.
Looking sharp.
Beautiful.
The backboard is your friend.
I'd say my coaching style is centered around fundamentals, with an emphasis on fun.
Hey, watch this.
Go get it.
Yeah! And a second emphasis on mental.
Yeah, it can be hard work.
But every time I look one of these kids in the eyes and he calls me Coach That's how I know I agreed to be a coach.
Mouse Rat! Mouse Rat! Carnage! - Carnage! Okay, gentlemen.
It's time for the pre-game coin toss.
There's no coin toss in basketball.
Are those women's sneakers? Yes, they are, Ron.
You know what? They fit better, I got an employee discount, and the best part is no one can tell.
All right, let's do this.
Match point.
Touchdown.
Et cetera.
Yeah.
Go, Lightning.
All right.
Okay.
I like what you're wearing, but I need it to be 300% sexier.
Do you have any of those shirts that look wet all the time? Or, like, a metal bikini? You know what's always sexy? Fingerless gloves.
What about if I wear this normal, sane outfit? Yeah.
Okay, but you're going to have to eat something sexy, then.
Like a banana.
For dinner? Well, what's sexy food? Asparagus? No, you know what's sexy? Turkey chili.
Yeah.
And how exactly am I supposed to casually steer the conversation towards the Parks Department budget? Okay.
It's totally easy.
Tell you what.
You be Chris.
I'll be you.
I'll show you how it's done.
Okay.
Ann Perkins.
You are wonderful and amazing and I'm happy to be here with you.
Thank you, Chris.
I'm wearing a tuxedo vest with no shirt on underneath.
Can I get you a drink? I love every single beverage in the world.
I would like some wine.
And Oops, my vest popped open.
Just like the budget needs to pop open and you need to pour it into my Parks Department.
Great.
I am so excited that you finally agreed to go out with me.
What a magnificent flip-flop.
You're a magnificent asker-outer.
Tell me every single detail of your day.
I love dates.
I love connecting with someone.
I love engaging them.
I love being surprised by them.
I have never had a bad date.
They've all been either great or phenomenally great.
Nurses are the most undervalued members of our society by far.
I think all of you should make as much money as the CEO of Google.
Wow.
Thank you.
I agree.
Can I ask you a question? Why am I so positive all the time? Yes, that's exactly the question.
I was born with a blood disorder.
And my parents were told that I had three weeks to live.
And here I still am, some 2,000-odd weeks later, and I have enjoyed every one of them.
I think it's going well.
He's actually a really nice guy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
So, have you asked him yet about the money? It's a date, you know? It's kind of hard to casually bring up the Parks budget when you're talking about your favorite movies.
Jurassic Park.
Parks are so great.
The Parks Department needs money.
I just did it in three moves.
Well, then, why don't you just come here and do it yourself? Okay.
Holy crap! What? Chris and Ann, what are you two doing here? We are on a date.
And it is going phenomenally.
Thanks, but I'll stay for just one drink.
I am so happy I ran into you, because I wanted to speak to you about Well, well, well.
Ben.
What a fun surprise.
That's right, you were coming here tonight on a date.
And hey, Leslie is joining you on this wonderfully romantic occasion.
How about that? - Fantastic! It is.
Can I talk to you? Sure.
What are you doing here? BEN: Just confirming a suspicion I had, Leslie.
What are you talking about? I had nothing to do with this date.
They're both so beautiful.
They probably just want to see each other naked.
Okay.
Well, I know what you're trying to do, and you're not that good at being sneaky.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
I'm great at being sneaky.
- Clearly, you're not.
Hey.
You guys, let's all have dinner together.
The more the merrier.
Great.
Great.
Great job, guys.
Yep.
All right, Eric.
Taking a rest, or are you hurt? Taking a rest? Smart.
Destroy them, gentlemen.
Feel no sympathy.
Yes, Ron Swanson is dating my ex-wife, Wendy.
Big deal.
My girlfriend, Lucy, is the sexiest woman in town.
She's Cuban, she's got tattoos, and she's into me, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the sexiest quality a woman can have.
Oh, I have an idea.
You know what would be really fun? After dinner, we should take a walk by the pond in Ramsett Park.
Walking in parks can be very romantic.
Yeah, too bad the park's always closed, though.
Okay.
Well, you two are on a date.
So, Leslie and I should probably get going.
Well, I'm actually having a good time with everyone.
Chris? Me, too.
I'm having a fantastic time.
What do you say we take this whole "date-plus-two- other-people" thing up into the stratosphere? This place is outstanding! Great call, Leslie Knope.
Thanks.
Look.
Even Ben's dancing.
That's the way to shoot the ball, Chignoli.
Hustle back.
That's a foul! What? On whom? Your team.
Number 50.
He was double dribbling.
He's on defense.
Exactly.
That's a technical difficulty.
So, that means Andy's team throws the ball from the stripey thing.
Let's go! "The stripey thing"? Hey, there, how's it going? Great, thanks.
Can I buy you a drink? I'm very flattered.
But this is my stunningly gorgeous date, Ann Perkins.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
No problem.
In fact, let me buy all of you a drink for being so welcoming today.
Waiter! I think I may actually like Chris.
On the house, Leslie.
Thank you.
I'm sort of a gay hero.
Last year, I married two penguins at the zoo, and it turned out they were both gay.
Penguin wedding? Mm-hmm.
That's cute.
It was so cute.
But enough about how cute it was.
Why don't you think I should have the money? Good Lord.
Really? Look.
When I was 18 and I became mayor of my hometown, I used every last dollar we had to open a giant winter sports complex.
Called it Ice Town.
And it turned out great and everyone loved it.
Yeah, kind of.
It was never completed, and I got impeached.
The newspaper headline was, "Ice Town Costs Ice Clown His Town Crown.
" They were big into rhymes.
Well, I don't know.
I think Ice Town sounds great.
And the point is, at least you tried something.
Foul! Foul on number three for taking a number two on number four.
Roughing the passer! Double dribbling! That's a foul! That's a foul for touching the basketball.
What are you going to do about it? Nothing.
You fouled.
You can't do anything.
Okay.
You're ejected.
You're ejected.
What's the matter there, Ron? No players left? Andy's team! Look at them go! Oh, come on.
Now, you're openly cheering for the other team? Put my boys back in.
You made me the ref.
Deal with it.
You know what? Take this uniform off.
Hey! Hey! You don't deserve to wear it.
Ron's ejected for molesting the ref! Yeah? I'm ejected? Tom, what are you doing? - Yes, you are.
I'm ejecting you.
You're ejected, too.
Everyone's ejected.
She's ejected? Yeah! Go ahead, go! Well, that's a forfeit.
Andy's team wins.
No way! We won? Oh, man! Eat it! Andy! Andy! Andy! - Andy! Andy! Andy! Yeah! Yes! I dedicate this victory to April Ludgate.
It feels good.
And it feels sticky.
From the Gatorade.
We're barely able to function.
We could really use that money.
Well, you know, I don't know if it's because I'm in such a good mood or because of the charming Ann Perkins, but I am going to seriously consider that.
Really? That's great.
Mission accomplished.
Let's boogie.
Mission accomplished? Yeah.
There's a mission that Ann had thought of.
It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's.
We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.
So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me.
Wow.
I've just had my first bad date.
Ann Perkins.
Not that sneaky.
April! April! Where have you been? Oh, my God.
Hey.
How are you? I'm okay.
I'm dying to see you.
I called and I texted you, like, a billion times.
I'm sorry.
I was in Venezuela.
Really? Wow.
Across the pond.
Wow.
I thought maybe I would have heard from you at least once.
Because of what happened.
Ann kissing me? I am so sorry about that.
It was so stupid and it meant nothing.
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's totally fine.
Hey.
This is my boyfriend, Eduardo.
No, it's not.
That means we're going to lunch.
How do you say, "Have a great time, don't choke on anything"? Bye.
Leslie asked me to do her a favor.
And I love her, so I did it.
I'm sorry, and I'm here to eat crow.
I like you a lot.
Let's go out again.
Ann Perkins.
Budget solution number 28.
Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.
Note.
Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.
Well, I got my answer.
About April.
She hates me.
Yeah.
And she got a boyfriend, I guess.
From some city in Mexico.
So what do I do? Okay.
Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just You You swing the hardest, damn it.
You go big or you go home.
And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.
I'm not.
I don't even really have a home.
Go get her, Andy.
Okay! Okay, thanks, Leslie.
Okay.
So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us.
My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.
And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.
Check your testicles? No.
Not that.
Although that is very good advice.
Looking at you, Jerry.
No.
What's going to save us is right there.
Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight.
But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die.
And we refuse to let that happen.
Now.
This town was historically known for two things.
Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival.
People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.
And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps.
We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts.
And I propose we bring the festival back.
With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back.
And believe me, people will come.
What if they don't? Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department.
And you guys are all on board with this.
Aye.
- Yes.
Look, we're not just pencil-pushers.
We are a reflection of the community.
And we believe that we can strengthen that community.
Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together.
That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard.
And a good idea.
Yeah, all right.
Excellent! Great! Okay.
So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session.
Hello, April.
Do you like the flowers? What are you doing? All due respect, Eduardo.
You seem like a great guy.
But I like April.
And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
So, do you want to go out with me? No.
I thought you were going to say yes.
But that's okay.
Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.
And again the next day.
And the next day.
Not Friday.
I have to go visit my cousin.
But I will be back after that to ask you again.
You should do it.
Follow your dream.
Oh, my God.
Really? That's awesome.
I'll see you tomorrow.

There is a crazy flu going around.
Lots of miserable, dehydrated people with high fevers and diarrhea.
And one of those dehydrated, high-fevered, miserable people is April.
Who hates me.
I want another nurse.
Well, there are none.
We're stretched pretty thin right now.
Then, I want a janitor.
They can do what you do, right? Yep.
Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.
Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.
I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.
No, I'm not.
What are you talking about? That's crazy.
And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.
Please don't do that.
Do? I can't do anything.
I'm sick.
My blankets are on the floor.
So, JJ, we wanted to talk to you about the Harvest Festival.
Yeah, I heard you were bringing that back.
Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself.
Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate.
And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.
But, I'm just feeling really tired.
I think maybe my allergies are acting up.
I've already vomited, like, five times today.
We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.
And we'd just love if you could come and join us.
Sure.
Anything for my favorite customer.
I bet you say that to all the girls.
Oh, no.
No, actually, you're my favorite.
You spent over $1,000 last year on waffles alone.
Here.
I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick.
Woman stuff.
Thanks.
All my parents got me was that.
Okay, well, I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, So I'm going to go.
Hey.
If you see Andy, will you not tell him I'm here? - Okay.
- Because of what happened, I don't want him to think - Stop! Don't want to know.
The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am.
I'm not interested in caring about people.
I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name.
Best friend I ever had.
We still never talk sometimes.
So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but Leslie.
Go home.
You're sick.
I'm not sick.
It's just allergies.
Come on, guys.
Just let me in there.
No.
You can't come in here.
You're not coming in.
Leslie, you look tired and you're all sweaty.
You look tired and you're all sweaty all the time.
What's your excuse? You want to go there, Jerry? - No.
- Fine, I'm coming in.
Donna, barricade the door now.
Donna, come on.
Just let me in.
Mmm-mmm.
Either go home or go back into quarantine.
I'm not going home.
- Get out of here, Leslie.
- Hit the bricks.
Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She's germing up all my stuff.
Aw, yuck! Leslie! Ann Perkins.
Hey.
How was your run? Ended with a five-and-a-half minute mile.
My personal low.
I think the pavement in this town is soft.
What's with the mask? Flu prevention.
My body is finely-tuned, like a microchip, and the flu is like a grain of sand.
It could literally shut down the entire system.
My body's like a chip, too.
A potato chip.
No.
Speaking of potato chips, you and I are on for dinner tomorrow, yes? Yes.
Definitely.
I'm super, super excited.
Looking forward to it.
Excellent.
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.
We've been on a couple of dates.
I really like him.
The problem is he's like a perfect human man.
I can't find one flaw.
There was one time I thought he farted.
But it was me.
I need to find someone to fill in for April.
Now, I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic.
April really is the whole package.
But I think I might know someone who will be just as ineffective.
Hello, Andrew.
What's new? A whole lot! Check this out.
I just invented it.
Super-straw.
So, just sit here and do your thing.
Do I have to tuck my shirt in? Because, honestly, that's kind of a deal breaker.
Let it fly.
Hey, wait.
Where is April? - Is she all right? - Yeah.
I just gave her the day off.
Would it be weird if I asked for the day off? Yeah, no, it's okay.
I didn't think so.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving? I thought we had a meeting.
No, we do.
It's just I think it's a little chilly in here.
Are you okay? Your eyes are glassy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my Is she Is she sick? Are you sick? No.
Yeah! She's sick.
That's why I'm wearing this, and misting myself with hand sanitizer.
I am not sick.
I just have allergies, okay? I took a Claritin and I threw that up, so I took another one.
I threw that up.
And then, I took a third and it stayed down.
I'm getting better.
- All right.
You're burning up.
- You're burning up.
What? I have to get out of here.
I have 2.
8% body fat.
My body is like a microchip.
A grain of sand could destroy it.
My body's a microchip.
- Leslie, go home.
- No, I can't.
I can't go home.
I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
- Commerce.
- If this meeting does not go perfectly, then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it begins.
I cannot go home.
Okay, then, who's your doctor? Ann's my doctor.
And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Now, I'm hot.
Now, it's really hot in here.
Okay, well, that's your fever.
Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here, and it says you could have" network connectivity problems".
104.
1.
Leslie, you're dehydrated.
I'm admitting you.
If I was sick, could I do this? - What are you doing? - Cartwheels.
- Am I not doing them? - No.
Look, don't worry.
I've done presentations like this before, and Tom will be with me.
So, you're in good hands.
It's not that I don't trust Ben.
It's that I don't have faith in Ben.
And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is.
I'll handle the general outline.
If you want to - Look.
- just jump right in.
The worst thing you can do with an important presentation like this is over-prepare.
- Well - So, I think it's best if I go to the spa.
No, we promised Leslie we'd prep for the meeting.
No, Ben.
You promised Leslie.
See, I never promise Leslie anything.
That way, I never disappoint her.
I try to be considerate.
Well, I am off for a soak and a schvitz.
Arrivederch.
Ron Swanson's office.
Yes, I will transfer you.
I just dropped another call.
I thought you might like a fresh set of pillows.
Are you trying to smother me? Help! This slutty nurse is trying to smother me to death with a pillow! Okay, never mind.
Stay back, slut! I know what she's trying to do.
She's trying to get me to break.
And you know what? I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to be professional and I'm going to put on a happy face.
And then, I'm going to go into a supply closet and snap a bunch of tongue depressors.
Okay.
So, let's talk about your opening remarks.
Do you want me to write you a rap? I'll write you a rap.
No, you know what? You're never going to be able to pull it off.
You're too white.
How about a show tune or something? I was just planning to introduce myself, non-musically, and then, get everyone to refer to their packets.
- And blah, blah, blah.
- No.
No "blah, blah, blah", okay? You need to go over every single detail with me.
Leslie, I promise you I won't half-ass this.
Okay? Now, get some rest.
I have some great news.
I think my fever just broke.
Goodbye.
It just came out.
I am starving.
I haven't had lunch since yesterday.
So, I'm going to head over to Callahan's.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.
They totally skimp on pickles.
Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you.
They have the most insane burritos.
I don't much go for ethnic food.
No, trust me.
They have one that's called the "Meat Tornado".
It literally killed a guy last year.
You had me at "Meat Tornado".
What are you doing? Hey.
That flu medicine really helped.
I feel a thousand percent better.
Good as new.
Does this scarf look okay? I don't want to look stuffy.
But I also don't want to look too "schlubby".
- Get back in that bed.
- So no to the scarf? Get back in the bed.
No, I'm going to that meeting.
Either you get back in the bed, or I will strap you down.
I've done it before.
Don't test me.
Okay, okay, okay.
Now, what superpower would you rather have? Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible? Ed, go first.
Fly, I guess.
I forgot to tell you.
You can only fly five feet above the ground.
I bring a certain panache and spice to the spa experience for these guys.
Before I joined, they were just three old white dudes quietly boiling in hot water.
Would you rather live in the pocket of a giant kangaroo or have a pocket on your own stomach that has a tiny kangaroo in it all the time? Preston.
Tiny kangaroo in my stomach pocket.
Forgot to mention, the tiny kangaroo is a racist.
- Hey, Ann.
- What happened? I just saw you a few hours ago, and you were fine.
Not like, "Damn, you're fine," but fine health-wise.
My body has no fat to protect itself from disease.
Things happen very quickly.
Listen to me.
It's very important that you replenish my body with electrolytes after every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.
- Oh, boy.
- My body tends to lose a lot of fluids when it's sick.
My brain is on fire.
I'm dying.
Well, you definitely have the flu.
Oh, my God.
The microchip has been compromised.
Pierre Garcon was a sixth-round pick.
Collie was the fourth round.
Indianapolis Colts know how to draft so well.
They really do.
Andy, this was delicious.
It's awesome, huh? It's a whole new meat delivery system.
Thank you, son.
What do you say we go out to the parking lot, run a few pass plays to burn off the calories? You are an unstoppable good idea machine! I like Andy.
I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department.
And that includes the men.
Hup, hup, hup! Peyton Manning reading the defense! Reggie Wayne, Colts corner! Andy, wait up! Hey, April.
I saw that you called for me.
What can I do for you? I need more flu medicine.
An actual request.
Well, you can't have any.
That stuff is powerful, no extra doses.
I didn't take any.
Leslie came in here and stole it and left.
Leslie? Leslie! Hey, have you seen Leslie? I had a dream that she came into this room, stole my flu medicine, told me not to tell you, and then disappeared through that hole in the wall.
The door? Maybe we should get, like, a suite here for them, okay? Ben Wyatt! Hello! Hi, Leslie.
- Good to see you.
- You, too.
Wow, you're really burning up.
Can I get some money for the cab that I took over here, please? Sure.
How much? I'm not sure.
I looked at the meter, and it had Egyptian hieroglyphics on it.
- Wow.
- Do you know the exchange rate? So should we do this? Oh, boy.
Hold on.
- Be careful.
- What? The floor and the wall just switched.
Okay.
Walk very carefully.
You know, I find it a little insulting that you don't trust me to handle this.
It's not that I don't trust you, okay? It's just this Harvest Festival is my project.
It's my career on the line.
And I just need to make sure that I've done everything I can to make it work.
Okay.
It's show time.
Okay.
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Leslie Monster.
And this is Nightline.
- Okay, I wouldn't open with that.
- No? - Why don't we sit down.
Okay? - Yep.
Libertarianism is all about individual liberty.
And it should never be defined by the terms "liberal" or "conservative.
" - And communism is no good, right? - That's right.
Big swing and a miss.
And what's the word for when a few clerics are in charge? Religious oligarchy.
Holy I can remember things.
I guess.
Hey, keep mine rare.
A man after my own heart.
I vomited somewhere in this room.
I don't remember where, though.
Wait.
You might want to check that drawer.
Stop pooping.
You have to get up off the floor now.
This floor is my friend.
Nothing like a complete physical breakdown to make a guy seem less intimidating.
I love the flu.
And then I said, "You know what? "I think we need to get these bananas out of here.
" Have a seat, boys.
Oh, hey, Tom, glad you could make it.
You have a nice day with your spa buddies? Actually, yes, Ben, I did.
And my spa buddies own a couple of car dealerships in town, and they've agreed to donate a fleet of vehicles for Harvest Festival, twenty-five vans for the entire event.
Okay, Tom, I'm ready.
Get up there and introduce me.
You got it.
I can't let you do this, Leslie.
Hey, this ain't your call, McCluskey.
Hey, Ron, can I ask you a question? Sure.
It's about April.
I don't like to get involved in people's personal I hurt her feelings, and now she's pissed at me.
I feel like if I could just explain myself, she'd understand, but she's avoiding me.
It's making me miserable.
April's in the hospital, sick with the flu.
What? I knew it! I didn't know that.
Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine.
You can go visit her tomorrow morning.
But don't tell her I told you.
I won't.
- No, no, no.
- Nope.
Okay.
Before we get started, a quick announcement.
Every Thursday night is ladies' night down at the Snakehole Lounge over on Burnham Avenue.
Ladies get two drinks for the price of one.
Oh, no, that can't be right.
That's way too good of a deal.
Nope.
That is what it says.
Wow.
That sounds like a fun time.
Anyway, it is now my great honor to welcome to the stage the woman responsible for the entire Harvest Festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope! Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight, has already made history.
In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone of Pawnee's small-business community, a weeklong showcase for everything from textiles to small farms.
By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival, and the monetary value of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure is, frankly, incalculable.
What? Three, two, one.
And my shift's over.
What the is your problem? Whoa, I thought you weren't gonna lose it.
While I was on duty, I didn't.
Now it's just me.
I get that you're mad that I kissed Andy, okay? But it was a moment of confusion, and it was a mistake.
And I'm very sorry.
You want to hate me forever? - Okay.
- Fine! You know what? I don't care.
But you shouldn't take it out on Andy, because he really likes you, and he did nothing wrong.
And just for the record, I'm starting to hate you, too.
That's the most I've ever liked Ann.
The time is now.
The place is Pawnee.
Let's make history.
- Thank you.
- That was amazing.
That was a flu-ridden Michael Jordan at the '97 NBA finals.
That was Kirk Gibson hobbling up to the plate and hitting a homer off of Dennis Eckersley.
That was That was Leslie Knope.
Thank you so much.
Any questions? Yes, sir? Are we going to get the same sales-tax incentives we used to? That's a very good question, sir, and I would counter with my own question, which is, why is half of your face all swirly? Okay, unfortunately, Leslie has another very important meeting right now.
So if you have any other questions, you can just direct them towards me.
Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap.
All right.
Okay, let's Excuse me.
And to answer your question, sir, there will be sales-tax incentives this year.
I think I should drive you to the hospital.
Was I wearing a tiara when I came in here? Because if you happen upon it, will you have Lady Pennyface retrieve it and send it post-hence? - Oh, hey.
- Hey, there.
I got you some waffles here, courtesy of JJ's diner, and chicken soup, courtesy of me.
- I'll take the waffles.
Thank you.
- Okay.
So how did the rest of the meeting go? Well, you said you needed eighty total businesses to participate.
Yeah.
We have 110, and counting.
So, nice work, Leslie.
Nice work to you too.
Left the chicken soup there, just in case.
It's an old family recipe.
It's not a big deal, but - Thank you for that.
- Okay.
Hi, April.
It's me, Andy.
Just stay sleeping.
I am going to be here when you wake up.
I will not leave your side.
You could be asleep for hours.
Maybe I'll come back later.
Hope you feel better.
Okay.
And I know you think that I'm a jerk, but I hope you can forgive me.
Gross.
Your forehead is all sweaty.
That's gross.
But I still like you.
Okay.
That's disgusting.
Got your message.
What's up? I got a call from the boys upstairs.
And they have a new assignment for us.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
And I feel like we should ask for an extension to stay here.
Yes, definitely.
You know, the festival thing's getting pretty huge, and a couple loose ends that need tying up.
Good, so I'll make the call then, to get the extension? - Yeah, they need our help.
- For the loose ends.
- Great.
- Good.
Okay, you need a ride back to the office? No, no, I'm gonna go for a light 15k.
I missed yesterday.
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.
Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen to put in the time capsule? These are my mother's diaries.
Wow.
Yeah, she lived in Pawnee all of her life and recorded everything she ever did.
Yeah, so it's, you know, kind of like a living document about the town.
Mmm.
A disappointingly good idea from Jerry.
Better than good, Jerry.
Perfect.
Give me that.
"January 18, 1964.
"Jerrold starred in his school production of Peter Pan.
"He was a beautiful Tinker Bell.
" It was an all-boys school.
Jerry! Hey, Leslie, I have an idea.
Why don't we put Eduardo in there and seal the top so that he suffocates and dies? Okay, Tom, you're up.
For my item, I chose a picture of my ex-girlfriend Lucy with a mustache drawn on her face and stink lines coming off her, 'cause she stinks.
She broke up with me.
Didn't really tell me why.
Luckily, when you're the guy, you can just tell people she's crazy.
"Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up.
" "Yeah, man.
Turns out she's crazy.
" That's what they always do on Entourage.
Ron? I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, JJ's diner, home of the world's best breakfast dish, The Four Horse-meals of the Egg-pork-calypse.
Wendy loves it, too.
And I am submitting this.
A brief history of everything that has ever happened since Pawnee was founded.
Not like you get extra credit for this, but I did type it from memory.
And for the first time ever compiled, it includes a complete list of every official town slogan we've ever had.
Oh, my God, Leslie.
- I know.
Can you believe it? That's crazy.
Isn't it? The Paris of America.
" The Akron of Southwest Indiana.
" Welcome, German soldiers.
" After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked.
The factory fire capital of America.
" Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers.
" Engage with Zorp.
" For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult.
Zorp is dead.
Long live Zorp.
" It's safe to be here now.
" Birthplace of Julia Roberts.
" That was a lie, she sued, and so we had to change it.
Home of the world-famous Julia Roberts lawsuit.
" Welcome, Taliban soldiers.
" And finally, our current slogan.
First in friendship, fourth in obesity.
" Yes, Pawnee has had its set of problems, but this time capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule.
And you can quote me on that.
I'm actually gonna quote you on all of this, 'cause it's a newspaper article.
I thought of a great headline.
Great.
"It's Time to Encapsulate the Future.
" Good one.
Sub headline, "The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule.
" I'll be back tomorrow with the photographer.
Okay.
Leslie, this guy's here.
Hi.
Can I help you? I'm Kelly Larson.
I read online about your time capsule, and I'm here to make a suggestion.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not taking Twilight books.
It's a beautifully told saga of vampires, werewolves and romance.
You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.
I thought you would be younger.
And a girl.
Well, I'm not.
I'm older and a boy.
But I feel very strongly that these should be included.
Can I tell you why? Sure, Kelly.
Have a seat.
Awesome.
And plead your case.
Thanks.
Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973.
Author Stephenie Meyer, née Morgan, was born in Hartford, Connecticut.
Oh.
You're going all the way back to her birth.
Okay.
So basically, Ann kissed me and then April kissed me, and I told April, because of honesty is important.
That's so true.
But now she's gone and gotten herself a Venezuelan boyfriend who's, like, the handsomest dude I've ever seen.
Present company excluded.
Oh, thank you.
I was talking about me.
Hey.
Ann Perkins! Andy just gave me a phenomenal shoeshine and I did not know that you two once lived together.
Yes.
Yes, we did.
Thank you for catching him up on our history.
Andy, that was an amazing shoeshine.
I can literally see my face in my shoes.
See you later! He didn't He didn't pay me.
Why are you hanging out with Chris? He just sat down.
What am I supposed to do? He's my boss.
No, he's not.
He isn't? God dang it.
I cannot figure out who my boss is.
Andy, I like this guy.
Please don't do anything weird, I beg you.
I just started dating Chris, and I don't know how, but Andy's gonna screw it up.
Andy screws everything up.
When we were dating, I bought him a fish and I don't want to get into it, but somehow that fish ended up dead in a cowboy boot.
And combined, they have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide.
Now, have you seen any of the Twilight movies? No, I have not.
Well, let me describe them to you shot for shot.
Movie number one.
Twilight.
We slowly pan up over a mossy log to see a deer drinking crystal-clear water.
Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like.
It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee.
I disagree, okay? The town of Forks, Washington is exactly like Pawnee, except for the climate and the vampires.
I'm sorry.
I have to say no.
I beg you to reconsider.
And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Then I'm gonna have to do this.
He brought handcuffs with him.
This whole thing was planned.
I think it's kind of cool.
It's not cool.
It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules.
Cool people make the rules.
They don't break the rules.
And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends.
Whoa, who are you even talking about? I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just annoyed.
But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak? He concerns me.
He's a genius.
I'll take care of this trespasser.
Give me 30 seconds.
I'm just gonna call security.
Guys, can we push the meeting an hour? What's going on? Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.
Damn it.
Again? You look sad.
You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.
It's a girl, isn't it? I can tell.
It's the look that Mike had on his face when Bella turned him down for the dance.
Oh, yeah? Is it? What look did your mom have on her face when she realized her son was a complete failure? Okay, I'll be quiet.
But I do know something about heartbreak.
And you know who else does? Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds? No.
A little lady named Twilight author Stephenie Meyer.
Trust me.
You should listen to him.
Those books are good.
Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties or time-traveling romances.
And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinnylegs McGee.
I'll tell you that much.
Okay, buddy, time is up.
Give us the keys.
They're hidden somewhere very far away.
Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.
Why? I'm not doing anything wrong.
Yes, you are.
You're trespassing.
Well, the fact remains this is perfectly legal.
No, it's not.
You're trespassing.
Look, I really don't want to cause any trouble, but I am not gonna leave until you put Twilight in the time capsule.
This muscle-headed Stormtrooper doesn't scare me.
Go ahead, Artie.
No! No! No! No! No! Please! No! No! No! No! No! No! Get him away from me! I am very scared of you! All right! Okay! All right! All right! All right! Stop.
If he wants to stay in there, I'll let him stay in there.
In two hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to He brought a pillow.
Hey, Leslie, I'm making some Sleepytime tea.
Do you want any? Hey, dude, wake up, man.
Oh, morning, Tom.
Twilight is dope.
I told you.
I couldn't put it down.
It was like she was peering into my soul.
Sing it, friend.
Here.
Book two.
Twilight: New Moon.
Get cracking.
There's a second book? And a third and a fourth.
No way.
It's fantastic.
Yeah.
I worked really hard.
I did every pair that I could.
I didn't know what to do with these.
I think they're gloves.
No, no, no, no.
Those are sports sandals.
They are for adventure racing.
They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology.
Dude, that is the coolest sentence I've ever heard somebody talk.
So you love April, and she has a new boyfriend, right? You got all of that from a picture? No, you told me yesterday.
Andy, I want to help you win her over.
Why do I want to help him? Because he's a good person.
I love good people.
Hey, you know who should wear these shoes? Monkeys.
Well, this is an interesting turn of events.
Is it? I don't know.
I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting.
What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about.
Hey, how's this for a headline? "Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams.
" God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story.
The key to April's heart is within you, Andy.
You need to tap in to the aspects of your personality that she once found attractive to make yourself the best version of yourself.
What's great about you? I'm nice.
Good! Nice.
What else? I'm in a band.
Band! What else? That's it.
Am I team Edward? Yes.
Do I share his concerns about turning Bella, though? Absolutely not.
Edward's primary goal, at all times, is Bella's protection.
Can you please, please be quiet? Sorry.
Sorry.
Let's keep it down.
Be considerate.
Look at it this way, Tom.
Bella's love for Edward is being tested.
By Jacob? Mmm.
Not exactly.
The Volturi? Yes.
Okay, you know what? All right.
I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst.
You seem tense, Leslie.
You know what you should do? Read Twilight? Read Twilight.
Here.
Yeah, thanks.
Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.
Good morning, Kelly.
Oh, morning, Leslie.
Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe.
It's a little more comfortable.
No problem.
Did you have a nice night? Sleep well? It was all right, considering.
Picked you up some coffee.
Thank you so much.
Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning.
I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here.
You know what I did last night? Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule? Well, I read the first 10 pages.
I couldn't really get into it, though.
More of a Harry Potter girl myself.
What? But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this.
Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle.
She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter? Is that why you did this? To impress your daughter? Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her.
She loves Twilight.
So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero.
That's really sweet.
You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.
I didn't want to drag her into it.
I'm sorry.
This is a mistake.
You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.
I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie, no.
We don't negotiate with weirdoes.
Yeah, what happened to, "A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee"? Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book.
Besides, I can get Shauna on board.
It would make a great human interest story.
Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe.
Well, yeah, that's a good point.
Then we shall bring the pipe to them.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
What does that mean? Crackpot convention.
So that's what today's forum is for.
We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule.
Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items.
Who'd like to start? I think we should put in the Bible.
Great.
Eduardo.
Hi, Eduardo.
I want to apologize.
Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.
I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you.
Thank you for saying that.
You're welcome.
What CDs are those? Mouse Rat.
My band.
It's our latest album.
Yeah.
You like music? What are you listening to? The Smiths.
Very depressing! April's making you listen to that? Mmm.
She's really into that indie stuff.
I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.
David Matthews! Crash into Me! Yes! I love that song.
Here you go, here.
Take one.
Check us out.
We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us.
Yeah, gracias.
That means "thank you"? Yes.
Nailed it.
So, we have one very moving case for Twilight.
Anyone else? Great.
Two people for Twilight.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation.
This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.
There are girls quivering.
There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth.
There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.
It is anti-Christian, it is pro-quivering, and the government has no business promoting it.
I totally disagree.
Well, now we have two people for Twilight.
Absolutely not.
I'm with the National Civil Liberties Association.
That book actually contains overt Christian themes, and as such, has no business being associated with any government project.
So too Christian, and not Christian enough? Do you see the irony here? No? Okay.
Uh Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight? No! You promised! You promised? That's not fair! Wait, it's not a question of fairness.
It's Go back to Russia, commie! Hey, you go back to Russia! You go back to wherever you came from! Why would I go to Russia? I have no interest in traveling to Russia.
Can I just say that? And who else? I would like to include my favorite book, Crazy from the Heat, the David Lee Roth story.
Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight.
I don't care about Twilight.
Why is this only about his favorite book? I want my favorite book in there.
Okay, I have an idea.
Two time capsules.
One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight.
No Twilight! Yes, Twilight! Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
I only have a second.
I have to get to work.
Bella's going on her first hunt.
I just don't get why you broke up with me.
Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough? Like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more? Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight.
It just didn't work out.
Okay? Well, what difference does it make? If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron.
Actually, that's the reason.
I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron.
You talk about it constantly.
Well, I can't help it, okay? I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss.
Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend.
Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit? Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass.
Look, Tom, I like you.
You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around.
So if you ever work through this, then give me a call.
My grandmother lived in Pawnee for 60 years, and I wanna put her ashes in the time capsule.
My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule.
For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules.
Except for Turnip! Except for Turnip! No chanting.
Look, we don't know what the world is going to be like in 50 years.
We could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu.
So what's your suggestion? I don't know.
I'm just scared.
Hey.
Aw! Andy! I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever.
We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours.
Is that cool? Yeah.
All right.
That's ridiculous.
Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven? Well, I think pet paintingslashes are in time capsule four.
No, that's baseball cards.
No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia.
Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories.
Oh, shut up, Kelly! Make me, Bob! Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God.
This time capsule's tearing this town apart.
You're leaving soon.
Can I blame it on you in the press? Sure.
Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive.
I've been to a lot of towns.
Usually people don't care about anything.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care.
Excuse me, everyone.
I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry.
But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now.
"Dear Pawnee of the future, "congratulations.
"You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago.
"We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent "what life was like in our town at that moment.
"Instead, you'll find only one item, "a video recording of a public forum we held "in order to determine just what those items would be.
"This is truly what life was like.
"A lot of people with a lot of opinions "arguing passionately for what they believed in.
"So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity.
"And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle.
"A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow.
"He had one job to do.
"Sincerely, Pawnee of the past.
" Is Eduardo coming? No, he went back to Venezuela.
Oh, that sucks.
He was a really good bassist.
I was actually starting to like him.
I know.
That's what made me start to hate him.
Hey.
Nice and band totally worked.
Have you enjoyed your time with Andy? Yeah, he's great.
And he told me how great you are.
And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.
He did, huh? He did.
And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had.
Would you like one? Absolutely.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Tom.
Tom.
Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything.
Okay.
Ooh! Hey.
Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up.
Dude, what did I just say? Hey, I was the guy who introduced you to How about you shut up?
Ron? Jack Cooper, from the Controller's Office.
Got a second? Sure, what can I do you for? Frankly, this is a little awkward.
We've received this letter from a collection agency about an outstanding debt from the Pawnee Public Library.
It appears you have an overdue book.
Oh, do I? Embracing Life with a Micro-Penis.
Tammy.
My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing okay.
And if I am, she tries to everything up.
Okay, I pre-dialed 911, so all you have to do is press send.
You're worrying over nothing.
If she binds your hands and you can't reach your phone, just try to chew yourself free.
Whale tail.
Whale tail.
She's flashing a whale tail.
Abort.
Abort.
Hello, Tammy.
Oh! Hello, Ron.
I didn't see you come in.
I was just checking myself for scoliosis.
And? Straight as an arrow.
Just like somebody else I know.
Jerky? Call off the dogs.
You and I both know that in my entire adult life, I have never checked a book out of the library.
Oh, my God, she's amazing.
Ooh! Mmm.
I admit there was a time when that sort of behavior would've driven me wild.
But I am in a healthy relationship now, Tammy.
A relationship? With whom? A lovely, intelligent, self-possessed pediatric surgeon named Wendy.
Sounds like a real whore.
Clear the late charges and cut the crap.
Good day.
Good day, Leslie.
Good Good day.
Okay, so we're ordering them a total of 30 pizzas, so let's talk toppings.
Sausage, onion, and peppers.
Scientifically proven to be the best toppings.
Nice.
Should we throw in some salads for a healthy option? Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben.
Yeah, Ben, these guys are cops, not ballerinas.
So we are throwing a little shindig for the police department because we're asking them to volunteer as security during the Harvest Festival.
I don't know what it is about big outdoor gatherings that makes everyone want to urinate all over everything, but it does.
And they do.
Okay, how about some calzones? Calzones are like pizzas but they're harder to eat.
They're dumb, and so was that idea.
Seriously? This is embarrassing for you.
Sorry to interrupt.
Ron, are you ready? Absolutely, my dear.
I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch.
All right.
Ron's girlfriend's pretty.
Tom's ex-wife.
Oh.
I don't want to see them together.
It's like they're rubbing it in my face.
All I can think about is Captain Mustache plowing my ex-wife.
And you imagine he's wearing a cape while he's plowing her? What? No, just, Captain Mustache? I mean, if all you can think of is Ron, you know Maybe put him in some tights and a cape, and then it would be funny.
Now I'm imagining a cape.
April? Did you call me? I did call you.
Good ears.
Chris's assistant went back to Indianapolis, so he's borrowing me for a few days.
Yay! I'd like you to get me some more Post-its.
I'd like them in multiple colors.
I'd like green.
I'd like yellow.
Do not buy orange.
I do not want orange.
I have plenty of orange.
Got it.
You want five million orange Post-its.
That's hilarious.
Oh, wait! I have a Post-it for you.
It says, "Great job!" Mmm Great job.
Mmm There you go.
They're getting really old, and I'm an only child.
I just feel like the right thing to do is to move back home.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I've really come to think of you as a companion.
Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to move to Canada? Canada.
No, I don't suppose I would.
Hey, I hate to nag, but shouldn't we be talking strategy, like, when to ask the chief for this huge critical favor? Yes.
I know exactly when we should do it.
Post-pizza, pre-ice cream, between his third and fourth beer.
He'll be full but not stuffed, tipsy but not drunk.
Should be around 9:00.
Okay, so you've thought this through.
Just sit tight.
I'll get you a beer.
Can I have two beers, please? Hey, you okay? Wendy and I are over.
She's moving back to Canada.
It's too bad.
I just taught her how to whittle.
She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
Look, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my girlfriends when they get dumped.
Men are dogs.
Thank you, Leslie.
That does not apply to this situation at all.
But thank you.
I appreciate it.
This is a disaster.
You're not into football? I knew there was something wrong with you.
I knew it.
I knew it, knew it, knew it.
Honestly, I haven't felt this good in years.
And it's not just because of the supplements he has me taking and the soluble fiber and the increase in regularity.
It's him.
He's moving back to Indianapolis in a couple of weeks, which sucks.
But if he asked me to move with him, I think I would.
I would like a local beer.
I'd like it in a bottle.
I'd like the bottle to be cold.
I would like a glass of white wine.
I would like it to be chardonnay.
And I would like that with one ice cube.
Thanks.
Chief Trumple? Hey, Knope.
You know Ben Wyatt from the State Budget Office.
Hello.
Yeah, how's it going? Thanks for the party.
Good pizza.
Great.
So, yeah, the pizza's dynamite, isn't it? I just said it was good pizza.
It's good.
Pizza's good.
You You know what I like? Calzones.
What the hell is wrong with this guy? Sorry.
We'll check in with you later.
Take it easy.
Yeah, will do.
What is wrong with you? I was getting somewhere with that.
Yeah, great small talk over there.
Okay, let me handle this.
I get a little nervous with cops.
I'm in control.
What's up? Tom Haverford's in the building.
Whoo! Tom, what the hell are you doing? Same thing you're doing, celebrating Pawnee's finest.
I believe you know my date, Tammy Swanson.
Hi-ya, Ron.
Oh.
Hi-ya, Ron.
Hey, Ron.
I'm sorry.
Is seeing your ex-wife on my arm making you uncomfortable? Gee, I can't imagine why.
Or can I? I like this song.
Do you wanna dance, Tammy? Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Ah.
I know Tammy seems scary.
But really, she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library-book-peddling, sex-crazed she-demon.
Yeah.
I think that's enough.
Tammy.
Hi, Ron.
I was just tasting my new boyfriend, Glenn.
Tom.
You don't know what you're mixed up in, son.
This isn't about you.
It's about me.
Typical Ron Swanson.
Always thinking about yourself.
Maybe we like each other.
Yeah, maybe we do.
Okay.
Let's take it easy.
Tammy, leave him out of this.
So it's okay for you to have a girlfriend, but I'm not supposed to see anybody? Damn it, woman! Just crawl back into the dank hole you came from and leave my friends alone.
Okay, okay.
Let's settle down.
What seems to be the problem? What seems to be the problem? Is there a problem here? Basically what we had here was a dispute of a domestic nature.
White male, 40, 45.
Caucasian male.
Stocky build.
Approximately 5'10".
Verbal altercation transpired at approximately 8:55 P.
M.
with a female unsub.
Appears to be slightly intoxicated.
Claims to be an ex-spouse.
Real piece of work.
Real piece of work.
Real piece of work.
Real piece of work.
I know why you're doing this, and you're making a huge mistake.
Fight fire with fire, Leslie.
He dates my ex, I date his.
Ron and Wendy aren't even dating anymore.
She's moving back to Canada.
What? Oh, God.
Okay, hey.
What's happening here? Ron and I are going to get a cup of coffee and talk things out.
It's time for Tammy and me to bury the hatchet once and for all.
Everything will be fine.
It's been like this for hours.
Right there.
Right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Swanson! Snap out of it! Leslie.
Congratulate us.
Ron's got one just like it on his penis.
Oh, yeah.
What the hell happened to you? Well Here you go.
Rock and roll! Yeah, baby! I got it! You may now kiss the bride.
It's been kind of a crazy night.
Come back, come back.
April, could you come in here a second? April, way to come in.
Great initiative.
You called me in.
Listen, could you please call Ann Perkins and tell her that I will be unable to enjoy lunch with her today, as I am just swamped.
All day.
Copy that.
Hi, Ann.
This is April.
I'm just calling to let you know that Chris can't make lunch today.
I knew you wouldn't care.
Good-bye.
They started having sex at the court house.
We had no choice.
Oh, well, I completely understand.
Chief, I need to ask you a huge favor.
Leslie.
Ron is a good man who just got caught up in something terrible.
And I was hoping that maybe you would reduce his charges and release him into my custody.
All right.
But keep him away from that crazy librarian.
I'll do my best.
In fact, I don't want him within 500 feet of the library.
That's good advice for all of us.
Nothing but trouble there.
Thanks a lot, bro.
Sorry.
Hey, stop.
Take me back to Tammy.
For the millionth time, no.
That was not the favor we needed to ask for, Leslie.
If we don't get the police for the Harvest Festival, there is no Harvest Festival.
I know.
I'll figure it out later.
Can you turn the radio off? This is our song.
Your song is Dancing on the Ceiling by Lionel Richie? Oh, wow, look at that.
You shaved off part of your mustache.
That's lovely.
I didn't shave it off.
It rubbed off.
From friction.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ron Swanson, this is an intervention.
You have been spending the last 24 hours sipping on joy juice and tripping on Tammy.
Well, the people in this room are your methadone.
And we're here to get you clean.
Congratulations! Holy matrimony, there's the man of the hour.
Jerry, what is this? That is the set of tumblers that I got from the registry.
This is an intervention.
I thought you said on the phone it was a reception.
Okay.
All right, let's begin.
I would like to address the goofy-Iooking, dirty-kimono-wearing, corn-rowed clown in the room.
If you see Ron Swanson, can you give him this message? You used to be a man.
You need to get your house in order.
Look, I love you like a brother, but right now, I hate you like my actual brother, LeVondrious, who I hate.
Okay, Tom.
Ron, you look great.
Your skin is glowing.
I've never seen you so happy.
Okay, sit down.
Andy.
Ron, I do not really understand what is going on right now.
But no matter what, you must keep going.
No.
You must stop.
I love you, buddy.
Follow your dreams.
Powerful stuff.
April? What are you doing here? I work for your boyfriend.
What are you doing here? I came to see why Chris stood me up for lunch, but I think I just figured it out.
Because he doesn't like you.
No, I'm pretty sure that's not it.
Actually it's because I didn't call you deliberately.
Which, if you ask me, is a fire-able offense.
So I would tell him that.
Also, he's not into you sexually.
Ann Perkins.
April Ludgate.
Literally two of my favorite people on earth.
I'm sorry that I had to cancel lunch.
Not at all.
It's not a problem.
April here was very apologetic on the phone.
She also sent me flowers.
April.
Nice touch.
Hello, Ron.
It's Ron.
If you're watching this, it means that once again you have danced with the devil.
Right now, you're probably thinking, "Tammy's changed.
We'll be happy together.
" But you're only thinking that because she's a monstrous parasite who entered through your privates and lodged herself in your brain.
So you have two choices.
One, get rid of Tammy, or two, lobotomy and castration.
Choose wisely.
You stupid.
This is a waste of time.
You people have no idea what you're talking about.
That was you on the tape.
That was you talking.
Ron? Ron! Ron.
There you are.
Ron.
Stop it.
God, please.
Ron, don't do that.
Oh, it's done, Leslie.
Tammy and I are in love, and we're gonna start a family together.
In fact, she's ovulating.
So if you'll excuse us, we're heading off on our honeymoon.
Wow.
Where are you going? Jerry.
We're gonna spend 11 days in my cabin in the woods.
We bought 10 cases of Gatorade and a Oh, God.
- Give me it.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.
Ann and I are headed out and I just wanted to thank you for everything today, and I will see you tomorrow.
Hi, Chris.
Ron Swanson has sent me over to deliver to you this document.
"To whom it may concern, dear Chris, "there is an emergency regarding the Parks Department, "and April may just be the only person who can help.
"I can't get into details because it's super-classified.
"Please release April back to us permanently.
"God bless America.
"Love, Bert Macklin, FBI.
" What? Okay.
Well, bye.
April, listen.
If you don't want to work for me, I'm not gonna force you.
You didn't have to do this.
She didn't do that.
That was Dude, I think it sounds like it was Macklin's call.
Look, I get it.
You're young, and trying isn't cool.
But I think you're smart.
I'm gonna be going back to Indianapolis soon, and I think you should come work for me.
Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements.
Everybody starts somewhere.
You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people.
Think about it.
Okay.
I will.
Apparently he wants April to move to Indianapolis with him.
So that's something.
I hope you're happy.
Look, I just wanted to show him what it felt like to have your ex-wife date someone you know.
Whatever happened after that is not my fault.
Yes, it is.
Tom, you did a really crappy thing, and I think deep down, you know that.
Whatever happens to Ron Swanson is on you.
Excuse me, chief.
Sorry to interrupt.
Hey, calzone boy, what's up? Well, here's hoping that that nickname doesn't stick.
Right? But that's not why I'm here.
Leslie Knope asked you for a favor the other day, but the real favor we need is much bigger.
You mean, like calzone size? Ah! Sure.
We need the Pawnee police force to volunteer as security during the upcoming Harvest Festival.
Now, the city won't let us throw the festival unless Say no more.
Just send me a schedule of how many officers you need and when.
Really? Just like that? Leslie Knope gets as many favors as she needs.
Can I ask why? Because she's the kind of a person who uses favors to help other people.
And also, my buddy Dave was the crankiest bastard in the department till he started dating Leslie.
So she Okay.
Are they still dating or No.
Moved to San Diego a year ago.
Was it a serious thing, or What do you care? You a pervert? Nope, nope.
I'm all good.
Everything's fine.
This is fine.
Don't think I won't do it.
I'll wear this to work.
All right, one more.
What's in here, huh? A new library card? Read the name.
"Tammy Swanson Swanson.
" You guys, that's amazing.
Well, you about ready to go, my love? Yeah.
Wait, wait, Ron! Stop! Tom? Jerry, what the hell? Don't do it.
She doesn't love you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
What are you doing here? Yes, I do, okay? When I asked her to be my date, she cackled for a full minute and said, and I quote, "Anything to make Ron miserable.
" It's not real, man.
She's just messing with you.
He's lying, Ron.
Stay out of this, Glenn.
It's Tom! And I'm not lying.
I'm not gonna let you destroy Ron.
You're just gonna have to Ow! Ow! He's attacking me, Ron! Kill him! Yeah! Do your worst, Glenn! You're gonna have to do better than that.
Why are you hitting yourself, Glenn? Stop hitting yourself.
Tammy, that's enough! What? Hey, baby.
You almost had me.
Again.
But seeing you pick on this pathetic, defenseless little man Hey.
reminded me what kind of a monster you are.
You're a joke.
You're not even a man anymore.
Oh, and by the way, last night, I faked four out of the seven.
So did I.
Let's go, son.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about the whole mess.
The crisis has been averted, so let's go talk to the chief.
I already talked to him.
They'll give us the hours we need, no problem.
Great.
What a relief.
Yeah.
Hey, are you hungry? I haven't eaten.
You know, yeah.
There's a really great calzone place over in "Idiotville.
" Oh, really? Down on "Terrible Idea Avenue.
" Okay.
That's weird.
'Cause I thought it was on" Beating-a-Dead-Horse Boulevard.
" Calzones are pointless.
They're just pizza that's harder to eat.
No one likes them.
Good day, sir.
Leslie, I You know, I I'm just kidding.
Let's go.
Okay.
That was funny.
High and tight.
Do you think it's gonna leave a scar? Tom, women like scars.
Shows you survived an attack, and they'll assume the attack was from a man.
Sorry, Ron, about everything.
To true love.
May we both find it.
I'll drink to that.
Nice glasses.
Wedding present from Jerry.
You're not gonna return them? Nah, too much hassle.
I found this typewriter next to the courtyard dumpster.
An old Underwood 5 with original carriage return.
Took her home, polished her up and bought a brand new ribbon off of electronicbay.
com.
Okay, somebody has got to do something.
I'm getting a cluster headache.
He's leaving.
Let's go.
I've got to throw it away.
No, I'm not.
It weighs a billion tons.
What is he typing, anyway? "If you sons of bitches try to remove this typewriter, I'll kill you.
" I'm going to type every word I know! Rectangle.
America.
Megaphone.
Monday.
Butthole.
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but these interviews are more important than we thought.
Harvest Fest is two weeks away, and awareness is still pretty low.
Boy, 35%? It's actually 34.
2%.
"34.
2%.
" I'm Ben, the numbers robot.
It's just an exact calculation.
"It's just an exact calculation.
" All right.
So, we're doing a huge media blitz to publicize the Harvest Festival, and we've got TV, newspaper, radio And I even called Oprah.
Well, I tried to call Oprah.
I couldn't get her number.
I'm putting it out there, like The Secret.
And hopefully, she'll call me.
Our first interview is at 93.
7 F.
M.
with Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Crazy Ira and The Douche.
They are Pawnee's most hilarious drive time radio guys.
So much better than Tubby Tony and the Papaya.
Am I right? They're seriously so funny.
Is this right? This feels almost perfect, but I don't think your core has maximized elasticity.
Okay.
I'll come back, if you guys are being weird.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're exactly the person that I most want to talk to, right at this moment.
And lunge.
Have you given my offer any more thought? What exactly would happen if I said yes? Well, you would work at the state house.
You would coordinate my professional and personal schedule, and we would give you a small relocation fee for your move to Indianapolis.
That sounds boring.
But I have nothing keeping me here.
Do you have Internet in your office? Yes.
Fine, I'll do it.
That is literally the best news that I've heard all day.
Unlike April, I still do not know what my future holds with Chris.
And it's starting to bum me out.
I need some more vitamin D.
Yeah.
Hey.
Crazy.
What was that meeting about? It turns out Chris is my real dad.
I think you're lying.
I think I know what that meeting was about.
You can't go to Indianapolis.
There's got to be something that I can do to convince you how much I care about you.
Tell me your least favorite things you have to do every day, and I'll do them for a month.
Fine.
If you do everything I hate for a month, then I might begin to think about the possibility of thinking about maybe staying.
That's all I have to hear.
You won't live to regret this.
Unless Andy can un-kiss Ann, then I'm not going to change my mind.
But if he wants to take my dumb sister to her dumb dance class, then I'm not going to dumb stop him.
Crazy Ira and The Douche, 93.
7.
You know why I'd never be an astronaut? Two words.
Space farts.
You can't roll down the window of the shuttle.
Am I right, folks? Houston, we have a What do you think about that, Neil Armstrong? That's one smallfor man, one giantfor mankind.
All right.
Switching gears here now.
We've got Leslie Knope and Tom "Haverfart" and Ben Wyatt.
And they're in the hizzy to talk about an upcoming event called the Harvest Festival.
Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome.
Meets agriculture.
And it is going to be next month, right here in Pawnee.
And spoiler alert, it's going to have the best corn maze ever.
You lost your virginity in a corn maze, didn't you, Douche? That's right.
To your mom.
Crazy Ira! Clean your room! There's also going to be hay rides.
"Hey, ride me," is what Crazy Ira's mom said.
Stop it! China Joe, you are a poet.
My bird is missing.
I need a permit to post signs.
Let me just look for that form.
There's no time! He can fly! Nine things April hates to do.
Number one, run the permits desk for an hour.
That's no problem.
I eat "running the permits desk for an hour" for breakfast.
Ow.
That's Ow.
Henry.
Stop it.
Great.
Ow.
Okay, Henry.
Cute kid.
Andy.
Got a sec? Yeah.
Henry.
Why are you working the permits desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets? I'm trying to stop April from taking a job with Chris, so I'm doing everything she hates doing for the next month.
That's going to work? She said it might.
But it's all I've got, man.
Give me the list.
I'll help you.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
You got it.
No, I don't care about their relationship.
I just don't want to lose April.
I would never be able to find a worse assistant.
Okay.
Thanks, Leslie.
But you know, what we really want to do today is have a chat with Ben Wyatt, here.
Come on, Ben.
Come on, Ben.
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kind of guy.
Well, it's either come with us or get in the spank chair.
So, maybe it's time for an interview.
Come on, everybody, give him a hand.
Come on! Come on over, Ben.
Yeah.
So, this guy, Ben Wyatt We're looking him up on AltaVista.
He's from some hick town, Partridge, Minnesota.
And when he's 18, he's elected mayor.
That's funny.
That's funny.
Yeah, he's 18, becomes the mayor, and then blows the whole budget on an ice skating rink.
City goes bankrupt.
Joke! Get out of there! What did you call it again, bro? What was it called? Say it.
Ice Town.
I was a kid.
And when you You end up getting out there and there's a I really wish you guys could see this guy right now.
He is drenched in sweat.
There's also going to be ponies at the Harvest Festival.
All right.
Let's take a caller from Douche Nation.
All right.
Talk to me, caller.
What's up, guys? Just douching over here in Eagleton.
Sweet.
Seems like 18 is pretty young for a mayor.
What were you, like, 12? The funny When I guess The fortunate Can we just, sort of Game over, man.
Game over.
Nice job, man.
Was that your first time talking to other people? Because it came off that way.
You embarrassed me in front of The Douche.
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just I haven't had to deal with that mayor stuff for 17 years.
I guess I'm not totally over it.
No worries.
Look, it was just a bump in the road.
Okay.
Fortunately, the Leslie-mobile is an all-terrain vehicle.
So, everything involving Ben is fine.
I just need to talk to you in private about something different that is not Ben-related.
Ben, good job.
Your boy's a nightmare.
I know, but we need him.
If they ask us about the budget, he's our numbers guy.
Well, we should just slap a pair of Ray-Bans on a calculator, because that would be way more charming.
I'll do the newspaper interview.
You and Ben do Channel Four.
Perd Hapley is a big softie.
It'll be a puff piece.
He can do it.
So, how are you liking Pawnee? There are a lot of cars.
I mean, not too many.
Trucks and stuff.
But, you know Cool.
Good talk, Ice Town.
Okay.
Wow.
Who knew that watercress, garbanzo beans and walnuts could complement each other so well? Good dressing, too, right? Flaxseed and agave.
Same basic ingredients as bird feed.
I'm just going to come right out and say it.
I want to define your bagua.
Okay.
What's that? It's a feng shui term.
The energy in this house is a little stale.
But I think I can redefine your flow in a very positive way.
Great.
I'm not really attached to the way this stuff is arranged.
Or the stuff itself.
Or this house, even, really.
Great, let's do it.
Am I not being obvious enough? I feel like I'm being obvious.
This just in.
Harvest Festival more like "Harvest Bestival.
" The Parks Department has planted the seeds, and now, they're harvesting the rewards.
Great.
You done? They'll put the fun in funnel cake.
Okay.
Now, I'm done.
Tell me about Ben Wyatt.
Sure.
He works for the state government, and he's been coming to advise us about our budget.
Come on, Leslie.
The Douche blew this story wide open.
Ben Wyatt bankrupts a town and then comes to Pawnee to tell us how to spend our money? There's no story here, Shauna.
He's just a dedicated civil servant who is doing whatever he can to make sure that this is the best Harvest Festival ever.
And he's easy on the eyes, too.
What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him? Strictly professional.
Just friends.
So, are you colleagues or are you friends? We are colleagues with benefits.
We're colleagues who benefit from the fact that we're also friends.
I'm sorry, Shauna.
I think I need to go.
But, thank you so much, and as always, everything I said is off the record.
Okay? Bye.
What's the next task? We have to write her grandmother a thank you note for a birthday check.
It has to be really good, too, because it's five months late.
Never written a thank you note before.
This will be fun.
What does she call her? Gamma.
No.
Nanna.
Or Nana.
Gizmo.
Something like that.
This is for your Gizmo.
I think you'll find it's pretty good.
"Dear April's grandmother" I said grandfather.
Oops.
Okay.
"You are a beautiful and amazing woman.
" Man.
"I hope someday, I can become half the woman you are.
" He's a man.
"Thank you for the $500.
" It was $5.
"Enjoy the Mouse Rat CD.
" He is deaf.
Okay.
Do you want me to make those changes, or is it good? Before we do this next interview, there's a little secret I want to let you in on.
It's called the "Haverford Schmooze.
" Look, I was just caught off guard.
I'm fine.
Three easy steps.
Smile, friendly physical contact and flattery.
"Hey, Perd.
Was your dad RoboCop? Because your arms are guns.
" RoboCop didn't have guns for arms.
Oh, my God.
That's so not the point, you nerd.
Just saying.
Why are we at a mall? We're getting you a new suit.
I've let this go on long enough.
I like this suit.
You shouldn't, because it looks like garbage.
Your suit looks more like garbage.
Really? Yeah.
Because Brooks Brothers Boys doesn't make garbage.
Okay.
This next thing is a photography class assignment.
Can you figure that out? "Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy.
" Melancholy.
Easy.
Boom.
A sad desk.
Boom.
Sad wall.
It's art.
Anything is anything.
Right on.
I'm going to go drop this off and pick up the mail.
Sad floor.
It does look sad, kind of.
Sorry for stepping on you, floor.
Hey.
You got Andy doing all your work for you? Yes, but he said he wanted to do it.
I'm only doing it because I'm getting him back Yeah, I don't care.
I got something to add to your list.
Yup.
There we go.
That's the stuff.
April really does this every day? Yes.
Work the heel.
Andy, can I be next? Yeah.
I have got a corn so big you could slap butter on it.
Welcome to Ya' Heard? With Perd.
I'm Perd Hapley.
The story of our guests today is that they are from the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Ben Wyatt and Tom Haverford.
What up, Perd? Big fan.
Me, too, Perd.
What up? The thing about this first question is, I'd like to ask you about the Harvest Festival.
Perd, it's going to be amazing.
Carnival rides, games Sweetums is even building a plus-sized roller coaster for some of Pawnee's obese thrill-seekers.
You must be this wide to ride.
Wow.
That's going to be a pretty big roller coaster.
Yup.
Hey, guys.
How did it go? Well, there were some sticky moments.
Let's go to the videotape.
Look.
Who hasn't had gay thoughts? Who? - Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I mean, you know, sometimes, I feel like I might need glasses.
Is there a bird in here? I swear, I keep seeing a bird in this studio.
Maybe that's all there is to it.
How did this happen? He was fine until Perd started asking him about the "boy mayor" stuff.
What's wrong with you? You look psychotic.
I was 18 when I was elected mayor.
Okay? So, excuse me for that.
Cindy Eckert had just turned me down for senior prom.
Do you know how that I should call her.
I should.
No, I shouldn't.
And I'm not going to.
And I'm proud of myself for that.
And then, he talked about feeling up Cindy Eckert for the first time for about five minutes.
And then, the show ended.
As did our careers and, probably, Harvest Fest.
Boom.
Sadness.
That's the one.
Natalie! Hey.
It's me, Andy.
You're an hour and a half late.
I know.
I know.
I had to massage a ton of feet.
Super sorry.
Come on.
Get in.
I need to do everything on April's list or she's not going to go out with me.
You're into April? Come on.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Hold on.
I'll get my books.
Okay.
Okay, great.
Call me.
That should be some damage control.
I'm having dinner with Perd Hapley.
Tom, what do we have? I've gotten calls from a dozen businesses thinking about pulling their sponsorships.
Sweetums might cancel the Fat-Coaster.
Oh, my God.
Okay, look, we need to focus.
We still have the Pawnee Today interview.
Well, is it too late to cancel? Yeah.
Yeah.
It's too late to cancel.
Joan Callamezzo runs this town.
But Ben, don't worry about it.
You're not going in front of the camera.
Fine with me.
Are you trying to lure this young lady into your van? Yeah.
But she's being really difficult about it, and it's actually not my van.
I stole it from a friend of mine.
I technically shouldn't be even driving, because my license is crazy expired.
That's Dwyer.
D-W-Y-E-R.
Dude! Come on.
I've got to get out of here! Natalie, tell this guy you know me.
Joan? I thought you were Jennifer Aniston filming a movie here.
Joan, let's make a pact, okay? If we're both still single in an hour, let's get married.
Tom, I'm already married.
That's right.
To Seal.
What? I confused you with Heidi Klum again.
See you later, Joan.
That's just That's how it's done.
- In five, four Hello, and welcome to Pawnee Today.
I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Today's guest is Leslie Knope, who is here to tell us how this year's Harvest Festival is going to bankrupt the city.
Well, Joan, actually, there's a lot of false information flying around.
The Harvest Festival is Jumping right in.
That's rude.
I just want everyone to know what an extraordinary event this is going to be.
But at what cost? How many cities does Ben Wyatt need to destroy before he's put behind bars? Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.
You know? If you want to ask him questions, let's go for it, huh? Just ask any question about his past or present.
Just get it over with.
Ben, let's get up here.
What? Yeah.
Come on.
We'll just ask him a bunch of questions, and then, we'll get everything cleared and out of the way.
Sound good? Yeah? Great.
Good.
Let's take some calls, Joan.
Why don't you? Okay.
Caller, are you there? Yeah, how can you justify raising taxes for something that will hurt the town? I For Just to add to what Ben's stammering about, we aren't going to raise taxes.
So, that's that.
Next caller? Do you fish, April? No.
Fish are gross.
Let me give you a piece of fishing advice.
I said I don't When you have a fish on the line, you don't just drag it behind the boat.
You either reel it in or you cut him loose.
Especially if he's a nice fish with a big, lovable fish heart.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe not.
Maybe you really do hate Andy.
Maybe moving to Indianapolis just to get revenge on him is a really good idea.
What do I know? You are going to love this.
Verosian tea really supercharges the bacteria in your colon.
Plus, it smells interesting.
Waft it.
Are we actually ever going to drink it, or we're just going to sniff it? I love sniffing.
Don't get me wrong.
You are hilarious.
So, you're leaving soon.
Back to Indianapolis briefly, and then, on to a town called Snerling, Indiana, for several months.
Never heard of it.
It's quite small.
The cows outnumber the people forty to one.
It sounds amazing.
I like you a lot.
I love spending time with you.
And I thoroughly enjoy you, Ann Perkins.
I just think we need to talk about what that means for us.
I don't want to be clingy.
No, no, no.
Please.
It is something that we need to figure out, and we should do that right now.
I'm so happy you said that.
Wow, that's disgusting.
Yes, it's very hard to drink.
Yeah, why should we trust this Ben Wyatt guy? Because I'm trusty.
Trust me.
I'm trustworthy.
And I am working very hard to make sure that this town gets back on its feet.
Here we go.
Okay, great.
Next caller? So, I looked you up on AltaVista, and I found out that the last seven towns you've gone to ended up bankrupt.
Okay.
First of all, why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997? And second, I am a budget specialist.
I went to those towns because they were bankrupt, and now, they aren't.
And yeah, I screwed up when I was 18, but who doesn't do dumb stuff when they're 18? Joan? I stole my gym teacher's husband.
So, there you go.
Well.
What else you got, callers? Going once, going Here we go.
Yeah, hi.
Can you tell me more about the corn maze at the Harvest Festival? Are dogs allowed? Hello.
Hello.
How did it go today? It was super fun.
It was? Yeah.
You have a list for tomorrow? You want to do this again tomorrow? Yes, I do.
I mean, it's the deal, right? I got to do it for a whole month, and then, you're not going to move to Indianapolis.
I better be the only person you kissed today.
Yeah, I'm positive that you are.
If I thought you were serious, I'd be offended, Perd.
But I know that we're buddies.
And I know you wouldn't do that to me.
But, no, this is a birthmark, Perd.
Okay? This is the little scar I got when I was nine and I fell off my bike.
So, no, I'm not perfect.
I can't look away.
It's amazing.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
Now, here's the best part.
Okay, that's all the time we have here on Ya' Heard? I'm Perd Hapley, Channel Four.
More like "Turd Crapley.
" Yes.
Yes.
Yeah? Bravo! Thank you very much.
Now, after we are given the certificate, who do you think should speak first? I think it should be me and then you.
But, if you want, it could be you and then me.
Or it could go me, you, me.
What do you think? How about just you? Thank you, Ron.
Yes.
Tomorrow, the Parks and Rec Department is receiving a commendation at the Indiana Statehouse for bringing the Harvest Festival back.
And although it's purely ceremonial, it's a huge deal for me to go to the Statehouse.
I couldn't care less about the commendation.
But Indianapolis is home to Charles Mulligan's Steakhouse, the best damn steakhouse in the damn state.
I have taken a picture of every steak I've ever eaten there.
June 2004.
Porterhouse, medium rare, Béarnaise sauce.
January 2000.
They call this one "The Enforcer.
" February '96.
The steak, rib eye.
The whiskey, Lagavulin 16.
The lady next to me, a bitch.
Specifically, my ex-wife, Tammy.
Okay, this is the first time I ever went there.
Oh, look at me.
I'm just a kid.
She's showing some elephant Ooh, la la.
Look who's fancy.
Am I wearing an ascot? I didn't notice.
Big night at the Snakehole Lounge! It's a launch party for Dennis Feinstein's new fragrance, Allergic for Men.
Pawnee's own Dennis Feinstein is a real up-and-comer in the world of micro-brewed perfumes and body sprays.
His ether-based perfume, Blackout, was named one of Maxim's top hundred ways to trick someone into sex.
Club opens at 6:00, event starts at 9:00.
No, no, way too late.
I will be deep into my bath by then.
Don't let us picture that.
Ben, you gonna go? I don't think so.
Probably just gonna take it easy, but thank you.
Yeah, they always ask me to go out with them.
They're just being polite.
I move around a lot, so the friends I make in these cities, they're like Facebook friends, you know? "Hey, Doug from Bloomington is thinking about buying a shirt.
" Come on, Doug, who cares? Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben and make him go to that antihistamine party.
It's "Allergic," and forget it.
He doesn't know anybody in town.
Come on, Tom, take him under your tiny little wing.
He's a fully grown man, Leslie.
And tonight's just not about pleasure.
I'm schmoozing Dennis Feinstein so I can pitch him my new cologne, Tommy Fresh.
Okay, well, while you're doing that, I want you to picture Ben in his motel room, all by himself with no friends, staring at the wall.
Deal.
Tom.
So my band's working on a new album.
Oh, yeah? What's it called? April Ludgate is the Best Ever, Volume One.
Shut up.
So, what do you wanna do tonight? We could watch TV at Burly's house or we could watch TV at your house.
Or, I mean, we could watch TV at Best Buy.
Why don't we go to Tom's thing? That weird cologne party thing at the Snakehole? I kind of forgot that you need money when you have a girlfriend.
I wanna treat April like a queen, and queens deserve flowers and massages, chocolate, booze, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, them treasure chests full of scarves, different kinds of lubes that warm up when you rub 'em on stuff.
I'm gonna give her all that stuff.
And more.
That sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know.
I guess we're dating.
It's new.
Whatever! I don't like labels.
Go away.
This? That would be good.
But does it say, "Hello, general assembly, "I've come to Indianapolis to accept your commendation?" As much as any one dress could.
Leslie, I think Chris is cheating on me.
What? That lying bastard! Wait.
How do you know? I don't have any actual proof.
Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.
And if he is, he's a monster.
And if he's not, you guys are great together.
But if he is, I will kill him.
Well, we had a really good conversation about our relationship last week, and he was very reassuring that we're headed in a good direction.
Great.
But then he got distant.
And when I asked to come visit him in Indianapolis, he was totally weird.
He was weird.
Look, it sounds like you're just spiraling.
But what if I'm not? What if I'm not? What if he has a girl up there? I think he's cheating on me.
Wow.
Okay.
Well, luckily, I'm heading up there.
I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.
Okay.
I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me.
In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury.
But that was because of my haircut.
Hey, champ.
Hey, champion.
Listen, you should come out tonight.
Club's gonna be dope.
Plus, I'm pretty sure you have nothing else going on.
Well, that's not totally true.
The owner of the motel I'm staying at said she was gonna screen Hope Floats in the lobby.
Asked me if I wanted to watch.
Yeah.
You should probably get out of that.
I think she's gonna murder you.
Come on down to the Snakehole.
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
Okay.
Yeah, no, I'll stop by.
Cool.
Thank you.
Hey, you mind if I ask? What are you gonna wear tonight? You know, I was probably just gonna stick with this.
Come on, seriously.
What are you gonna wear? Something totally different.
Probably go home and grab something.
Cool.
If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second-largest rocking chair.
No.
Then maybe we should take a quick two-hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.
It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home.
No.
What's wrong with you, grouchy pants? I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.
Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron.
Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth.
When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.
I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight.
Please tell me he's meeting us at the restaurant.
No, we are picking him up.
Damn it, woman! Welcome.
I am so glad you guys called.
This is gonna be great.
Come on in, come on in.
Sure.
Or we could just Wow! Look at your foyer.
It's like a spa in here.
Exactly.
The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.
And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.
You cannot limit that.
Yeah.
Ron doesn't even have a front door.
He won't even tell me his address.
Ask him where he lives.
Where do you live? Why? So this is some kind of coat closet or something? Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here.
I like coats.
Could I use your bathroom really quick? It's right behind you.
Okay.
Toilet seat's up.
Hey, let me get a beer and a Pawnee Sunrise.
Do you wanna pay cash or start a tab? I It's okay I know Tom.
Tom who? Tom Hammen Hammenstein.
Haverford.
Haverford.
He's, like, my best friend.
Hey, Freddy, this guy says he knows Tom and wants a drink for free.
You got money to pay for those drinks? Yes.
No.
Make room for the paying customers, huh? Let's go, Knope! Just one second.
Hey, what's up? Hey, I think you might be right.
I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.
Are you serious? What the hell? You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something.
I don't I'm coming up there.
Wait.
All right, okay.
All right, let's go.
Oh, my God.
They just forgot to unlock the door, that's all.
Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation.
Ron, stop it! Ron? They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.
I should have been here.
What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed? Do you think they got eaten? Why don't we go back to my place and I'll fire up the grill? You sure you're not expecting company or something? No.
What do you say, Ron? Go back to my place, I'll make you some grub? It'll be just as good as it would've been here.
Okay.
Okay.
That man is a legend.
Think about all the scents he's created.
Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob.
Dennis Feinstein, though? I don't know.
He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.
Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee.
Okay.
So what's your plan? Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, " Uh-oh.
"Looks like you just inhaled your future.
" Yeah.
That might actually work.
Is everything okay? It kind of sucks that I'm super broke and I wanna buy you stuff and it's embarrassing that I can't, but I'm broke too, and I don't want anything.
I just wanna hang out with you.
Plus, I can get free drinks any time I want.
How? I'm a girl in a sleazy club.
Hey.
Hey.
I hate drinking alone.
Can I get you a drink? Sure.
Triple whiskey.
What's your name? Oprah.
I'm Kevin.
Cool.
I kind of wanna drink alone.
But I said I wanna drink alone.
Thanks.
Bye.
Here.
You take this one.
I will get myself a martini from that idiot.
So, Chris, do you have any sisters? No, I don't, Leslie.
Do you have sisters? Maybe.
So how's your mom? Is she visiting? No, she's home up in Wisconsin.
Is your mom visiting? Any aunts? Nope.
You have aunts? Girl cousins? A youthful grandmother, perhaps? Nope.
Did you forget how to have a conversation? I am so happy you guys are here.
I'm gonna go fire up the grill.
I'm gonna kill him, Ron.
Why? Chris is cheating on Ann.
There's evidence everywhere.
She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Ask her to bring some garlic salt.
I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.
I got this from a waiter.
I told him I had a pork deficiency.
Sweet! Pigs in a blanket.
I always wondered why they call them that.
Look what I got.
Look what I got from the bathroom.
Mints.
Six of 'em.
Nice.
Yeah.
Okay, whoever gets the most free stuff by the end of the night wins.
Deal.
Go! Ron, would you like some salad? Since I am not a rabbit, no, I do not.
Try it.
Salad's good for you.
You got it.
Mmm.
Delicious.
So, Chris, what do you do up here in your spare time? Well, I exercise, and I exercise my mind.
And I try to keep up on current events.
Oh, that's what you call it.
Sorry? How are things going with Ann? You know what's funny about Ann? She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably.
Oh, is that what's upsetting you? This is very uncomfortable for me.
I don't know what to say.
Watch the master work it.
I'm the Yoda of networking.
Well, Yoda wouldn't actually need networking.
I mean, his powers were more spiritual.
Shut up, you nerd! I get it.
Okay.
Mr.
Feinstein, Tom Haverford.
I'm the organizer of this soiree and I'm also a huge fan of yours.
I use all your colognes.
Sometimes two at once! I don't recommend that.
Are you from the FDA? You know, legally, if you're from the FDA, you have to tell me.
I wanted to talk to you because I actually created my own scent.
Great.
I'd love to smell it, right? I know you're a busy guy.
Yeah, man.
I'm crazy busy.
But all day long, people are pitching me colognes.
That guy just pitched me a cologne called Sluts.
I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
Not just anybody can do this.
Although it's a great name, and I'm probably gonna steal it.
Please, it'll take two seconds.
If you like it, maybe we go into business together, branch out in other states, move over to watches and fancy raincoats, open up stores in London and Paris.
I don't know.
I haven't thought it through.
But for now, I want to present Tommy Fresh.
All right, I get it.
It's a gag scent.
Hilarious! As in, "It's hilarious how awesome it is"? It smells like somebody spilled Chinese food in a bird cage.
Horrible! It's assaultive.
It takes everything in my power to not retch right now.
Kid, you need to find another game.
Leave perfumery to the real men.
Hey, Ann, if you get this, I don't know if you should come up here.
He's not worth it, okay? Call me, let me know where you are, and if you have Ron? What in the devil's name is this? Portobello mushrooms.
Where's the steak? There's no steak.
That's a healthier option.
It's organically grown.
Lord.
Ron, are you okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
Could you get us a cold compress or something? Hey, six beers for table 12.
Do you work here? Yeah.
My dad owns this place.
I'm Janet.
Janet Snakehole.
Hey! This round's on the house! All right! How about some tips? Gum or mint, sir? Gum.
Then a mint, I guess.
All out, sir.
Don't have those either, sir.
Do you have anything? Out of everything, sir.
This is so awesome! We are like Robin Hood.
We steal from the club and we give to ourselves.
Look, we'll find a 24-hour diner.
Or we can get one of those cows that we saw on the way up here and we'll bring it back and we'll make steaks out of that.
Ann Perkins, what are you doing here? Whose pink razor's in your shower? Excuse me? Leslie found a pink razor and a pink swimming cap in your shower.
Whose is it? I guess you're talking about my razor.
I shave my legs for swimming, and women's razors work better.
For whatever reason, men's razor technology hasn't figured out how to properly contour the shinbone.
And the swimming cap? Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Triathlon, 2009.
Came in fourth! Well, I found concealer in your medicine cabinet.
What's that about? I'm a human being.
Sometimes I get blemishes.
I'm not perfect.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry, honey.
I'm so embarrassed.
I was scared that you were cheating on me.
No, I'm not cheating on you.
But I'm also not dating you.
We broke up last week.
We talked at your house.
Do you not remember this? Of course I remember, but we didn't break up.
I'm sorry, Ann, but I'm certain we did.
Okay, you said that you didn't wanna leave Pawnee and that I was the most amazing woman you had ever met.
Which you are.
And then I said that I would move to Indianapolis if I had to, and you said you didn't wanna make me do that, and then you said that in a different world Oh, my God.
You broke up with me.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, so here's what happened.
Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it.
It's kind of understandable.
Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.
Oh, my God.
You left, and you said you were gonna work late, and I kissed you? As enjoyable as that was, I did find it odd.
And then I wanted you to meet my parents? I'm sure they're great people, but strange.
This is humiliating.
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
Hey Hey, man.
I got you another melon-tini.
Thanks.
Listen, that guy is a jerk, and if you ask me, he smells like Success! He smells like success.
You know what I smell like? A teriyaki hairpiece? I smell like the guy who's always coming up short.
And you know what? I'm just sick of it.
Tommy Fresh was my dream.
Now no one's ever gonna smell it but me.
I can smell your dreams, Tom.
I can.
And I can smell 'em from here.
And honestly, they smell terrible.
But I like Tom.
I've got a jar of olives.
Nice.
A thing of toothpicks that look like swords.
And a year's supply of toilet paper.
I got Boom! $38 in tips.
$180.
We should give it back.
We should give it back.
Follow me.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
Thank you.
One time, when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him.
There was another time where I was on a date and I tripped and broke my kneecap.
And then the guy said he wasn't "feeling it," so he left and I waited for an ambulance.
One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again.
One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.
Skywriting isn't always positive.
Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, "Don't eat anything.
Rebecca's coming.
" And then he broke up with me.
Who was Rebecca? Yeah.
Exactly.
Thanks for driving me.
Wait.
You're getting your commendation tomorrow at the Statehouse.
Oh, please.
It's just a goofy ceremony.
I don't even care about it.
Leslie.
Besides, Ron is staying behind.
He'll go.
Is Ron gonna be okay? I honestly don't know.
This isn't a steak.
Why would you call it that on your menu? I don't know what to tell you, man.
Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
Wait, wait.
I worry what you just heard was, "Give me a lot of bacon and eggs.
" What I said was, "Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
" Do you understand? It's called a Tommytini.
It's just vodka and a bunch of cinnamon.
That sounds gross.
- Ben.
Oh, Miller Lite.
How'd you know? Everybody knows.
That's your drink.
Tommy.
Let's do this.
Mmm.
How's it going? Hey, look who's socializing! Yeah, and I'm having a good time.
Sit with us.
Okay.
Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.
Yeah, like a week ago, right? Yeah, but I only knew about it an hour ago.
So that's why you tried to kiss him.
We were all seriously confused about that.
Who's "we"? What are you Oh, God.
Did you keep the toilet paper? Yes.
I feel bad, but I need it.
Hey, hey, that's gotta be Feinstein's car.
Give me Give me the Tommy Fresh.
Why? Give me Tommy Fresh.
He's gonna smell your dreams now.
Are you okay? Is it that bad? Oh, my God, it's unbelievable.
Okay, everybody.
The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.
And I am so proud of all of you.
You've worked so hard.
You're amazing.
So, I have a surprise.
And it is possibly the best thing to potentially ever happen to anyone, anywhere, in the history of the universe.
Ladies and gentlemen, the world-famous Little Sebastian.
What? - Yes.
No way! Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd get to meet him.
It's really him.
Well done, Leslie.
Well done! Little Sebastian made his debut at the last Harvest Festival in 1987, and he was an instant phenomenon.
For the next few years, Sebastian was the number one boy's name in Pawnee.
And the number three girl's name.
So, what am I missing? What's the deal with this pony? He's not a pony, Ben.
He's a mini-horse.
There's a big difference.
Well, then, why is he so famous? Does he do something? What does he do? Son, this horse has an honorary degree from Notre Dame.
We all need to be very careful.
Okay? Remember.
This little guy is 25 now.
And he has cataracts in both eyes.
He has severe arthritis.
Jerry's going to look after him.
Yes, I am.
We are both on the same diabetes medication.
Are you my Glucotrol buddy? Are you? Isn't it amazing? Yeah.
I've just got to be honest.
I don't know what the big deal is.
Get out.
Okay, couldn't you put Sue's Salads here? On Deep Fried Boulevard? It's just There's so many junk food places and only one salad stand.
Well, there's a lot of people that don't consider salad a food.
The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.
And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated.
That's why we're going big.
Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000-plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks.
God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing.
Clowns.
Man, you are just knocking these off.
You're like a ninja crossed with a Jedi or something.
You're like a nerd mixed with a dork or something.
Tom, Star Wars is not that nerdy.
No, Star Wars is not that nerdy.
It's not.
Everyone has seen it.
Everyone has seen it.
Everyone.
This guy's here.
Hey, Ken.
Hi, Leslie.
This is Ben and Tom.
That's a dope bolo.
This is Ken Hotate.
He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.
Have a seat.
Ken, I know why you're here.
And just let me say that we really tried.
I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one.
I'm under a lot of pressure.
I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.
I'm sorry.
What's going on? The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven-day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons.
During the battle, was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry.
Did he die? Yes.
And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.
Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides.
Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive.
This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.
The atrocities are in blue.
We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent.
I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground.
And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.
There are two things I know about white people.
They love Matchbox Twenty, and they are terrified of curses.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines.
Take that, curse.
Take that, curse.
Ow, ow, ow! Right in the chest.
Bazooka.
That's funny.
Ugh, get a room.
Okay, so guys, focus up.
Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last-minute walk-through of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow.
So, everything needs to be perfect.
Joan is always looking for a scandal.
She's like an eagle-eyed tiger.
Eagle-Eyed Tiger.
New band name.
I call it.
So, everybody, gather around.
Let's grab hands.
I don't hold hands.
Okay.
You're all amazing, wonderful people.
And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs.
That's not inspiring.
Okay.
Let's go get them, everybody.
Okay.
Yes.
Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man? Chris? He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it.
I've done that to multiple men.
How are you doing? Are you doing okay? Thank you so much for asking.
It's been tough.
Yeah.
Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave.
I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.
Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.
I did this to my hair.
You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems.
I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.
That's what my mailman said.
Murder.
Murder the most melons.
Shaquille showered.
Shame on Shakira's sheets.
Hello, Joan.
Hello, Leslie.
Looks like a very impressive festival.
But we'll see.
We'll see.
You remember Ben.
Hi.
It's nice to see you again.
Let's get started.
Okay.
Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival.
And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.
Wow.
Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn? Pawnee corn.
And it's organic.
Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel.
Beautiful, but deadly.
When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected? Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is How many of these carnies are illegals? None.
They're all U.
S.
citizens.
Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday.
You got Tilda? Yeah.
We got Tilda.
But the real coup is over there.
Little Sebastian.
Are you kidding me? You got Little Sebastian? See for yourself.
Wow.
He is so adorable.
Thank you, Joan.
And Little Sebastian isn't bad, either! Tom! How are you? Good.
Good to see you.
Hold on a second.
What? Did you get your breasts done? You look amazing.
Yes, thanks for noticing.
Joan, listen to me.
This Harvest Festival, it's going to knock your socks off.
And when it does, I'm going to be there to give you a foot massage.
To completion.
Okay.
Good lord.
I swear.
It's almost like they don't want you to win.
Well, you better practice.
You've got to win me a teddy bear.
I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.
Well, I want a billion teddy bears.
Well, that's a little unrealistic.
This is a hard game.
Two million.
Deal.
All right.
Hey, I love you.
Dude, shut up! That is awesome sauce.
You're such a good boy.
Jerry, stop bothering Little Sebastian.
Leslie said I should watch him for a little bit.
Perfect.
I've got to go get him a tail scrunchie.
Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous mini-horse.
I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge.
Wow.
That is a shockingly huge mini-horse erection.
What about your friend Ben, here? We all know his story.
One of failure, remind us of that failure.
Well, you know, when I was an 18-year-old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city.
Yikes.
I was also shortstop of my J.
V.
baseball team.
No one ever brings that up.
And now, you're involved with this.
Do I smell another disaster, hopefully? Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness.
Not even I could screw that up.
I'm a reporter, not your therapist.
So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it.
Am I a genius or what? Hey, Tom.
Where's Little Sebastian? Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry.
What? What are you talking about? Unbelievable.
Another in a long string of miserable failures.
You lost Little Sebastian! I wasn't even here! Exactly.
You look for him.
I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.
The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.
m.
tomorrow morning.
And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time.
Come on down, everyone.
It's going to be sweet.
It pains me to say this, but great job here.
Thank you.
That went well.
Yeah.
It did.
Take that, curse.
Take that, curse.
Sorry? What is this about a curse? Curse? What? Nothing.
Did you Leslie! Leslie! It's Little Sebastian.
He's gone.
Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is.
Keep those cameras up.
We've got a new intro to do.
Gotcha.
Let's go ahead.
Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.
How about some of those spooky traffic lights? Okay, you know the drill.
Okay.
This is bad, right? This is way worse than that.
This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod.
And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy.
Double lightning rod.
Plus, we lost that little pony.
It's a mini-horse.
And that's the third lightning rod.
Triple lightning rod.
And then, you have the curse.
Quadruple lightning rod.
God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down.
Wait.
I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses? Oh, no, no, we all just behave rationally and believe we are all in charge of our own destinies.
Come on.
What the heck are we going to do? How did this happen? Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.
That's not bad.
Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off.
Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot.
Andy, April, check the corn maze.
Good idea.
Horses love mazes.
Come on.
Hey, Leslie? This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse.
No comment.
Did you say, "No comment"? You've got to say "No comment.
" I did.
Good, Ann.
You're so beautiful.
Beautiful Ann.
All right.
Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month.
Okay.
Okay.
Run, Ann, run! Leslie? You've got to see this.
Yeah.
Thank you for having me.
The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site.
Much like the house in the movie Poltergeist? Exactly.
I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.
We do have exclusive animation of that event.
Let's take a look.
Oh, I love these things.
Sorry.
Is that what happened? Perd None of that happened.
That is exactly what happened.
All right.
All right.
What we do is we move the shooting gallery.
That seems to be their biggest problem.
Maybe that will make them happy.
Check back in with News Channel 4, number one in curse coverage.
You know how Indians call corn "maize"? This is why.
I never knew that.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to go look by myself.
Hey, are you alright? You seem super not happy.
I'm fine.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow.
Forever.
You're not fine.
Ludgate, something is upsetting you.
Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is? I'm not mad at Andy.
Andy's great.
I awesome sauce Andy.
April! Left.
Look right.
Yeah, okay.
I don't know what's sicker, me or your body.
You aren't sick.
Maybe you should check out my abs.
Are you experiencing abdominal pain? Every day at the gym.
Eww.
Feel.
Oh.
What are you doing tonight? I think I'm going to have to pass.
Your loss.
Are you going to hit that? Him? He isn't exactly boyfriend material.
Who said anything about a boyfriend? Use him.
Abuse him.
Lose him.
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you find him? Yeah, Jerry.
He's right here in my pocket.
Damn it.
Ground mission failed.
We need a bird's eye view.
You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel? We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow.
Okay? Wow.
First, Ice Town.
Now, this.
Bad luck really follows you around, huh? Okay.
I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.
First of all, we have plenty of food.
There is no food shortage.
There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival.
And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, "feasting on petting zoo animals.
" You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed.
Look, I'm only going to say this once.
What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel? How about you only say that never? Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten? It will not be a disaster.
It will be a success.
And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request.
So, yes, Perd.
Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question.
Will that be enough to lift the curse? Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God.
Crap on a spatula.
It's the curse.
That's exactly what it is.
You know what? Everyone, relax.
Please, we'll get this up and running in no time.
Well Jerry, what the hell? I didn't do this.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
We cannot catch a break.
Yeah, well, I'll help you out.
I'm going to go.
What? I feel like I'm jinxed or something.
What are you talking about? Look, you were totally fine until I got involved.
So, I feel like I should probably just go.
Okay? I'm really sorry.
I'm the curse, I think.
So, I'm going to get out of here.
All right? When they're missing this long, they're usually dead.
Well, if that's true, then you're going to have to answer to the whole town.
And God.
Okay.
You were the one who let him out, Tom.
Okay, now, stop trying to blame me.
Jerry, can you please be quiet? I can't hear myself not talking to Andy.
Ron, will you please tell me why April is mad at me? Ron, can you please tell Andy All of you, be quiet.
Andy, she's mad because you said "awesome sauce" instead of "I love you, too.
" April, he loves you.
Stop being a child.
Tom, you're clearly at fault here.
Blaming Jerry won't save you.
Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Little Sebastian.
So, everyone apologize to everyone else.
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- I'm sorry.
I do love you.
You do? Yeah.
That's what, you know, makes the sauce so awesome.
Jerry just farted.
I'm very upset.
I get nervous.
Hey, Leslie? Generator's shot.
No.
I got the T.
M.
K.
2500 specifically for the extra capacity.
Wow.
You know your stuff.
You single? Not now, Ed.
How could that happen? All those TV crews plugged in and overloaded it.
Okay.
How and where can I get a new one in, like, I don't know, now? There's only one place in town that has a generator that size.
You've got to be kidding me.
So, you need to borrow our generator? Ken, I am coming to you on my knees, begging for help, much like the early settlers of Pawnee begged the Wamapoke Now, but that was a A trick, and over 50 Wamapoke were slaughtered.
I know, but this is not a trick.
I am prepared to put the Wamapoke history exhibit inside the carnival grounds, right past the entrance turnstile, so that you have to look at it before you start having fun.
Now, that's interesting.
It's been really awesome looking at you.
Most carnival nurses are total grenades.
Okay, you're all set.
You are free to go.
Or you could stay here and make out with me until the lights come back on.
Hell, yeah.
Beat it, Donna.
Aye-aye, Captain.
I'm just trying to do something good for this town, and I'm trying to save my friends' jobs.
Can you help me out here? A Native American tribe making a deal with the government.
What could go wrong? You can have the generator, Leslie.
Thank you, Ken.
And I will issue a statement saying that the curse has been lifted.
Well, actually, I have another idea.
With that sacred ceremony, the Wamapoke curse has been lifted.
Wow.
Thank you.
Intense stuff from Ken Hotate.
And in other good news, he gave us a scare, but he's back now.
The one, the only, Little Sebastian.
We spotted him from the top of the Ferris wheel, at the center of the corn maze.
After the power came back on, we went and got him.
It took us four hours to solve that maze.
It took the horse 15 minutes.
Jerry's still out there.
I suppose I ought to go look for him.
Right after I get a bratwurst.
Welcome.
Come on in.
Have fun.
Thanks.
Enjoy yourself, ladies.
Hey.
Hey.
Look who's back.
I'm sorry I left.
I honestly felt like I was cursed or something.
Ice Town, and now, this.
Ice Town was a disaster, and it seems like it was probably your fault.
From what I can tell, you mismanaged the hell out of it.
Wow.
Why even say that already? But the point is, this project, this is as much yours as it is mine.
It's ours, and it's going to be really great.
And I'm glad you're here.
Wow.
Thank you.
Is this the guy? Yes.
This is him.
Ah, yes.
Special Wamapoke ceremony.
The curse has been lifted.
Wow.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Gosh, you're filthy.
Go clean yourself up.
Try to look professional.
Hello.
Enjoy yourselves.
Hey.
I like your necklace.
My God.
He is just the best ever.
You're the best ever.
But he's a close second.
Aren't you, Little Sebastian? He really is amazing.
You finally get it now, right? Hello? He's fantastic.
I totally get it now.
I don't get it.
At all.
It's kind of a small horse.
I mean, what am I missing? Am I crazy? Hey, Ben, you just missed it! He whinnied! Yeah.
No, I totally heard that.
It was great.
Gee whiz.
The Harvest Festival was a real triumph.
We had over eighty thousand people in attendance, which surpassed our wildest expectations.
I would like to specifically single out Leslie Knope.
I speak for the mayor, city council, and all of Pawnee when I say we can't wait to see what the heck you're going to do next.
Step on up here, Les.
Thank you.
Paul, are you okay? Uh Oh, my gosh.
Holy! Oh, my God.
Call 911! That was the second most awkward way a man has ever grabbed my breast.
All right, guys.
Everybody, listen up.
Just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow.
We're all gonna meet here and leave as a group at 6:45 a.
m.
, promptly.
Why are we doing this? Harvest Fest is over.
We do not wanna have a sophomore slump.
This camping trip is our chance to think of some really big ideas.
Why don't you just tell us what our next project is, and I'll go camping by myself.
Look, I have ideas, Ron.
Okay? I have, like, 100 new ideas.
But the point is, the pressure is on.
We only have one chance to make a second impression.
What portion of this camping trip will take place outside? All of it.
Pass.
Can't pass.
It's a mandatory work retreat.
I have a question.
What if we're scaling a cliff and I start to fall? Can I grab onto your boob for support? No, Tom, don't.
Her boob kills.
My boob does not kill.
Paul did not die.
He had a heart attack, which required an octuple bypass.
Besides, the Pawnee Sun said that my chest saved his life.
How's the best municipal department in Pawnee? That's you guys.
Paul is going to be recuperating for a while.
So, the mayor asked me to step in as City Manager.
And I of course accepted immediately because Pawnee is literally the greatest town in the country.
Of course, I am gonna miss Indianapolis, which is the most wonderful city in America.
I'm so excited to be working with you all again.
And Leslie, I cannot wait to hear your new big idea.
I wanna hit the ground running, and your new mystery project is going to be the hydration pack that gets me to the finish line.
You're all my little hydration packs.
I'm sure I am not.
Ron.
Are, too.
Hydration pack! Hey, you gotta hear this hilarious story that he's telling me.
Tell her what happened.
My identity was stolen.
His identity was stolen.
Tell her about the accounts.
They were frozen.
Frozen.
Bye, Kyle.
Where are you going? Oh, my God.
How's the coolest chick ever? Not good.
What do you mean? Leslie's making us go on a camping retreat.
That's awesome.
Camping's the best.
Camping sucks.
It's super boring.
And you can see the stars, which I hate.
They're creepy.
I love camping.
I bet you I can get you to love it, too.
Why don't I meet you out there? If you hate it, we'll leave and go make out.
But if you love it, we'll stay and make out.
Either way, a ton of making out.
You in? Ann Perkins.
Chris.
Hey.
I heard you were back.
Yeah.
I didn't do this because of you.
Well, it looks great.
Yeah, you look great.
Am I right? It's So good running into you.
You know, we should get together soon.
I'd love to catch up.
Me, too.
Catch up and mustard.
Ketchup and mustard.
I just was Oh! So delightful.
I relish your wit.
Well, I salsa your face.
I should hate him.
He broke up with me.
Well, there was an ex that I still liked after he broke up with me.
But it was really hard to stay mad at him.
He was an amazing dentist.
You know, when he saw me, I swear his face lit up.
Ann.
What do you think "We should get together soon" means? No.
Do not read into this.
Remember, this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive, when he broke up with you, you didn't even know it happened.
Yeah.
Come camping with us.
It'll be really fun.
You'll be away from Chris.
You can brainstorm.
I'll give you first dibs on s'mores.
Okay.
That sounds fun.
Here is our official retreat schedule.
It divides our time evenly between work and play.
Come on, everybody.
Let's hustle.
Let's get to the brainstorming! Great attitude, Ron.
I just wanna get the work over as soon as possible so I can do some fishing.
Fishing relaxes me.
It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something.
All right.
I call this wonderful spot.
You didn't bring a tent? I don't really go camping ever, Jerry.
So, I'm not going to spend $150 on a tent.
I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.
It's called the ground when it's outside.
Whatever.
Why? Do you guys do this a lot? Camping? I've never been before, but I think I'm gonna love it.
Why am I gonna love it? SkyMall.
Come check out my tent.
I ordered a bunch of crap off SkyMall.
I got my TV, my Xbox, DVD.
Awesome bed right there.
DJ Roomba's in the mix.
It's like I'm not even camping.
This is actually a dog couch, but it's super comfortable.
It's really important to me that April loves camping.
So, I went ahead and set up the ultimate campsite love nest.
Complete with beautiful starlight.
We got champagne.
Also, rose petals.
As you can see, they smell terrific.
We need big ideas, and we need 'em now.
Who wants to go first? I propose that we take all the money we made from the Harvest Festival and return it to the citizens.
So, how much would that be per person? About 83 cents.
Per household.
Before postage.
Are we done? What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common? Oh, I know this one.
They are all rappists.
Oh, my God.
They're rappers, Jerry.
And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.
Why? Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.
Until now.
The Pawnee Amphitheater.
How much would that cost? Not that much.
$200, $300 million.
Right.
Great.
Luxury dog park.
Do you want to tell us any more? Poodles only.
No pooping.
Hey.
Where are you? I'm here.
Where are you? We're inside the main entrance, near the sign that says "Pawnee Campground.
" I'm in a totally different place.
That's why we can't see each other.
My God, Andy, I don't even wanna be here.
The air is too fresh.
It's disgusting.
I can't breathe.
There's a brook somewhere that won't stop babbling.
Shut up! Sweetheart.
Just hold tight and I'll be there.
Well, April is right here.
And I am down here somewhere.
How about we just invest the money? Make 4% a year.
You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city.
What do you think? Great idea.
Thanks, white Urkel.
All right.
Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart.
What are you even still doing here? Harvest Festival is over.
Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis? Hey.
Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works.
And he's a valuable asset to the team.
Thank you.
April has not presented her idea.
April? I didn't come up with anything.
Why? Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea.
She's got a point.
Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome.
That's what I'm calling my tent.
I am really disappointed in all of you.
You know, the whole town is looking at us right now.
And you're letting 'em down.
Take an hour.
Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.
And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department.
Then, after that, I will tell you my idea.
Wow.
You really let 'em have it.
Well, I had no choice.
I didn't wanna tell them my idea.
Why not? Because I don't have one.
I don't have an idea, Ann.
I'm so screwed, Ann.
The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything.
Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house? Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.
What about those binders in your office? They're filled with small ideas.
We need a big, juicy idea.
I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me.
"I married ALF and we're pretty happy.
" That sounds nice.
It was.
Okay, listen to me.
You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine.
You're probably right.
I just need an hour and it'll come to me.
Hello? Andy, you have to save me.
I'm camping with people I work with.
Hello.
April.
Hello? Walk around in circles like I am.
Help triangulate the phone call.
Hello? Hang on.
I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.
I found some thorns.
I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend.
But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control.
You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity.
What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects? You know what I should do? I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.
That might be incredibly effective.
Hey, Tom.
One second.
I'm just in the middle of a head massage.
Well, that's a good stopping point.
What's up? Uh You wanna bounce some ideas off each other? Here's a better idea.
How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef? All right.
I know Leslie seems upset.
But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles.
So, there's really no point.
Care for some fondue? Yeah.
Hey.
How do you afford all this stuff? I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.
The key is crying a lot.
No one likes to hear a grown man cry.
"And then, my hand accidentally went in the panini press!" Hey.
You wanna go for a walk? Yeah.
Wow.
The sky is really beautiful.
It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.
It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma? No.
Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal.
I'm probably making too much out of it.
Oh, no, no.
It's really big.
I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival.
Now, you're gonna seal the deal.
It's the chance you've been waiting for.
What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that? Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.
So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself? No, no, no.
No, no.
Not at all.
I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.
I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government.
And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection! Okay, guys.
Listen up.
What was that? That was me talking.
No, I heard it, too.
Andy? If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now.
Oh, my God! Hey, guys.
What are you doing here? I was just out for my nighttime run, and I thought, "Why not go visit the Parks Department?" How's everything going here? Super great.
Really well.
We have a great idea.
Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.
I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.
Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute? Let them work? Oh! Sure.
What was that? What was that? Leslie, just tell us your idea.
Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself.
Here it is.
What do you think? I don't have an idea.
I'm sorry.
I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something.
But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed.
And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.
And then we got it and we're good.
Go with that.
I think I'm gonna turn in.
You're not going anywhere.
No one's going anywhere.
No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.
And that'll be fun.
We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, "Hey! No one sleep!" Do you hear how loud that is? You're not sleeping through that.
Is there anything else to eat? The marshmallows are all gone.
We have nothing to eat.
Jerry scared all the fish away with his loud personal stories.
I wanna go home.
I miss my canopy bed.
Yeah.
I'm fine with not camping.
Especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me! I'll fire up the van.
You know, I've never moved this slowly before.
It's almost like being in quicksand.
Hey, um, listen.
When you dumped me, it was really embarrassing.
You just kind of took off.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I mean, I never meant to hurt you.
And well, I'm back now.
Hey, I have a great idea.
Why don't we go to this rustic diner that I know? We can have egg white omelets and we can continue to talk about us.
Sounds good.
No, no.
Chocolate or butterscotch? Swirl me.
Dude, camping is awesome.
I love it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
How long have you been running power to this tent? I don't know.
How long have we been here? Ten hours.
No! I was TiVoing Cupcake Wars.
This is ridiculous! Look, I am used to a certain level of comfort in my life, and I didn't want to sacrifice that.
Okay, well, I packed everything up.
So, now, you're telling me I have to go unpack it? Guys, this is a sign.
You wanted to leave, and now you're stuck here with me.
So, we can work all night.
This is gonna be so much fun! All-night work! All-night work! All-night work! You know what? There's a bed and breakfast right up the road.
I'm gonna head there.
Yes.
Let's keep brainstorming.
I have a good feeling about this B&B.
One day, there's gonna be a plaque there that reads, "This is where Leslie Knope came up with the amazing idea for" Damn, I thought that would work.
So, while they re-paint the lines in the parking lot, we're asking everyone to do street parking.
I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.
'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
All right, moving on to recycling.
You okay, Ron? Just a little tooth pain.
I'm fine.
Continue.
Okay, each department will be getting blue bins Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron? I don't like dentists.
Just a second.
Hey.
No, no.
No! No, no, no, no! Oh! What the? Oh, my God! I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about? Recycling? Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your co-workers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
Attention, everybody! Everybody, listen up.
You are all officially invited to a dinner party, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home.
That's it.
There's no more left.
Give it to him.
We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special.
And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things, dinner and parties.
Parties.
Yeah.
It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot.
Don't be late.
Watch out.
"Dearest Tom, please bring silverware.
" "Please bring cooked steak.
" This is ridiculous.
They're young.
They're in love.
They're ready to show it to the world.
It's very sweet.
And we're all going.
- What? There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
You going tonight? Yeah.
Apparently they want me to bring Avatar, and 50 pairs of 3-D glasses, and a 3-D-capable television.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Well, I will see you there, with all of those things.
I was actually coming to see you.
I wanted your advice on something.
Oh, yeah? My boss in Indianapolis, he wants me back on the road in a week.
But then this morning, Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him.
Do you wanna do that? Well, I don't know.
I've been moving around so much the past few years.
It might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
What do you think? Well, this is a great city.
You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world.
Sure.
But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government.
So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or It's a tough call.
You know what I would do? You should make a pros and cons list.
That always works for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, maybe I'll do that.
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.
Good stuff.
Okay.
Yeah.
So how does this work? All right, you just fill out your name tag, and you're all set.
Okay.
But I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or Are you asking me how to flirt with men? Okay.
All right.
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is awkward.
Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
So be honest, what do you guys think? You know what, Jerry? I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due.
You know, I like how the Damn it.
I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.
April's friend Orin is here.
He's very intense and very weird.
So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.
What'd you bring? I was in charge of the cake.
To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf.
You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction.
But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake? No, a cake, but this is so much healthier.
So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake.
Take a walk, Ron.
Yep.
Donna.
Oh, my God.
I am so excited to see you here.
These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
What? Do you know where you are right now? We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.
It's every woman for herself.
You're joking, right? Do I look like I'm joking? Dating is a zero-sum game.
If you get a man, I don't get that man.
I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Here's some more advice.
Beat it.
Hey.
Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
Well, you are a huge nerd.
But I'd be sorry to see you go, man.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, this party needs a little help.
I'll be right back.
So are you going on, like, a year-Iong walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand? To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of Peter Jackson's interpretation.
So you can put that one away.
Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out.
Totally agree.
Just firing up the Bagel Bites now.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
What do you think? April, you're not supposed to let me see you.
No, come on.
You have to look.
This is important.
You have to tell me if I look good.
Hey, guys, what's going on? Uh It's supposed to be a big surprise.
But tonight, me and April are getting married.
To each other.
Is April pregnant? Are you pregnant? Yes.
Yes? No.
Are you sick? Are you terminal? Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember? Yes.
What? No.
God.
Oh, God.
Why are you doing this? Why is this great thing happening? Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story.
We were hanging out.
And suddenly, I was like, "What if we got married tomorrow?" And she was like "Fine.
" She's like, "Fine.
" That is a great story.
But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live.
We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live.
Yeah.
Like, a house or, like, a condo or something.
Probably a condo.
You can't just get a condo.
No, you're right.
House.
I love Andy and April as a couple.
I want them to stay together forever.
But relationships need planning.
You just can't jump into something without thinking.
It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time! Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Whoa.
Secret wedding.
Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza? Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them.
It's not really my place.
Or yours.
Hi.
I'm Ann.
Brian.
What's your occupation? I'm a manager at a sporting-goods store.
No way.
Me, too.
Seriously? Which one? No, I'm not.
I was just ribbing you.
What are you drinking? Yeah.
What? Oh, I don't know.
I couldn't hear you.
So you just laughed and said, "Yeah"? Yeah.
Excuse us.
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Did you grow up in the woods? Are you Nell from the movie Nell? I told you I'm rusty.
All right, come with me.
Hey, Andy.
Yeah.
I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, something just occurred to me.
Can I be your best man? Yeah, dude, totally.
Thank you.
My best man.
Best man! One of my life goals is to be a best man.
It's a baller position.
You get drunk.
You make speeches.
And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing, from behind.
Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do.
I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before.
But you know what would be fun? Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together.
It'll be a blast.
Leslie, relax.
You relax.
You relax all the way home and get into bed.
You need to go to bed.
April.
Girl talk.
Hey, what's your middle name? The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
You don't know each other's middle names? I don't wanna say it out loud.
- Ew.
- Shut up.
Roberta! Such a loser.
Can't believe I'm marrying him.
You don't have to.
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.
Then I'm gonna marry him again.
One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours.
And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
And he was married.
But the clothes thing really bothered me.
You always wanna scribble the name.
Make 'em read.
Draw them in.
Make 'em work for it.
Right.
Two shots of Jameson.
Don't make too much eye contact.
You wanna seem available, but not too available.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.
I'm not gonna Yeah.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff.
I love you, man.
Would you be one of my best men? I'd be honored to, son.
Chris, you helped me get April back.
Would you be my best man? Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Jerry.
I'm so glad you made it.
This shirt is hilarious.
Derek and Ben, will you be my best men? Got a little competition for the best man, huh? Well, you know what the best best man does.
Excuse me! Are there any strippers here? Former strippers? Non-dancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk? What are you doing? I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
It's my duty as best man.
The wedding's in four minutes.
It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Hello? Hi, Ann, it's Leslie, Leslie Knope from the Parks Department.
Yeah, I know.
Where are you? April and Andy are getting married tonight.
What? Yeah, I know.
I need you to get down here, Ann.
I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
I don't know, Ann! Help me, please! Relationships are like scuba diving.
If you come up too fast, you get the bends.
And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends.
No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.
Wait.
Are you asking me or telling me? Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yes, please.
April and Andy are about to get married.
Wow.
My Brita filter's older than their relationship.
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter? I don't know.
It depends on how frequently you use it.
True.
Stay focused, okay? Please.
The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.
And nobody seems concerned about this.
Attention, everybody.
Mesdames and Missoirs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence.
What? Big event in that room, Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later? Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party.
You're at our wedding.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate.
I guess I kind of hate most things.
But I never really seem to hate you.
So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Is that cool? Yes.
Is it my turn? Yes.
"April, you're the most awesome person "I have ever known in my entire life.
"I vow to protect you from danger.
"I don't care if I have to fight "an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him, "your mom I would take 'em down.
" Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
I'm telling you.
It's okay.
I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
And now the rings.
By the power vested in me by the State of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Go fly away.
Fly! Fly! Wings of love.
Okay.
All right.
So that one is dead.
We know that.
You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know.
I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered.
Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie, I got married twice.
Both times, I was a lot older than those two.
And both marriages ended in divorce And a burning effigy.
Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.
That's all anybody can do.
Wait.
Weren't you married three times? Oh, my God, you're right.
I get to burn another effigy.
The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance.
Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool.
I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it.
Thanks.
That was beautiful.
You two remind me of me and my husband, George.
I gotta nail the speech.
So I brought in an expert.
Jean-Ralphio.
Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good? Sure.
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously.
Swingers or Crashers? Fred Claus.
Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.
Quote from Love Actually.
Hold back your tears.
Pause.
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.
I wish you the best of luck, to both of you.
Thank you, Grandma.
How could anyone ever possibly top that? Am I right? So, thank you all for all the talking.
Let's just get back to dancing, huh? Cool.
See you around, maybe.
That went better, right? Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes.
" I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.
So? So that's my ex-boyfriend.
We were together for a really long time.
All right.
What? What? Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.
I'm a nurse, actually.
Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry? Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy, who has been looking at you, and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself? All right.
I just wanna thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man, Mr.
Tom Haverford.
Oh! Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you? No.
But you You're straight? Yes.
Jean-Ralphio's just a friend? Yeah.
Yeah! Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married! This is crazy.
What happened? But, seriously, life is short, right? Uh, just I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy.
That's what April and I did.
We are in love.
So we didn't overthink it.
I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this.
Am I right? All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you, April Roberta Ludgate.
I love you.
I love you.
Yeah, yeah Oh, Grandma April, there's so little time The things I really want to do Let's fly to the sky It's so awesome Exactly.
Mortality.
See, I like to take each day at a time.
There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
I have to go.
It's been great talking to you.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna say another word.
This is your day.
I just wanted to say that I'm really glad you're here.
I think you're awesome, and I love you.
What's the deal with that hot girl, April? What's the deal with her? Yeah.
Like, is she good to go? Like, is she down to clown? She's married.
She got married, like, 20 minutes ago.
Oh, my God.
That's the same girl from the thing.
From the wedding ceremony, yeah.
All the good ones are taken, huh, bro? Yeah.
Hey.
You should stay.
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.
You think? Yeah.
Yes.
It's a great city here, you know? And there are great people.
And you've made a lot of friends.
And what are you gonna do? You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets? Stay here.
Help us build something.
I already accepted the job.
I'm staying here.
That's good.
Yeah, I think so.
Orin's behind me, isn't he? Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So just keep your eyes on me.
Okay.
Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear.
What do I Just keep talking to me.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you? Good.
How are you? How was the wedding? Run! "Hey, Ann, it was great talking to you last night.
"Hope we can get together soon.
" Okay, now you write, "Who is this?" Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy.
Oh.
Okay.
How you guys doing? Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
It is awesome.
We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
We're having so much fun.
Except for Roberta, here, turns out, sucks at water skiing.
Oh, my God.
So bad.
I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy sucks at driving a boat.
And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now.
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Pawnee is, as you all know, the fourth most obese city in America.
Soon to be number three.
We're coming for you, San Antonio.
No, we are not.
We are slimming down.
Starting right here at City Hall.
I am implementing a government-wide health initiative.
We could have a City Hall dodgeball league! I have first pick, and my pick is Ron.
Great idea! Keep 'em coming.
Now, if anybody would like to join me, I will be running backwards up the big hill behind the Walmart.
Don't freak out, but Joe from Sewage just unhooked your bra with his eyes.
What? Oh, boy.
Hi, Joe.
What's up, Knope? Looking good these days.
What do you say? Van's out back.
Let's roll.
Where is this coming from? I don't know.
You're putting out some vibe today.
It's just driving me crazy.
Listen, if you're looking for a good time, why don't you come on down to the Toilet Party? That's what we call the Sewage Department.
Great.
Okay.
Liking the view.
Still got it, Joe.
- No, you don't.
Christopher.
Got a second? Oh, hey, Ron.
Listen.
I've eaten a commissary hamburger for lunch every day for 12 years.
I just wanted to make sure this pointless health crusade won't affect the only part of my job that I like.
Oh, no, those hamburgers are gone.
Red meat can cause sluggishness, heart disease, even impotence.
Has the opposite effect on me.
You ever tried a turkey burger? Is that a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger? If so, yes.
Delicious.
A turkey burger.
You take lean, ground turkey meat, you make that into a burger instead of red meat.
Why would anyone do that to themselves? What if I told you that I could make a turkey burger that tastes better than any other burger you've ever had? Challenge accepted.
Cook-off later today in the courtyard.
If I win, hamburgers remain in the commissary.
What do I get if I win? The rarest jewel of all.
Victory over me, Ron Swanson.
I like that.
We're on.
You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually checked out that snow globe museum that you recommended, and it was pretty awesome.
Yeah.
I have to say.
I mean, I did get in trouble for shaking one Yeah, I'm not allowed there anymore.
So, I have some ideas for the health initiative.
Oh, okay.
How about I swing by later and we'll just, you know, we'll go over everything? Or we could go out after work.
You know, go to J.
J.
's or something, grab a bite? Um, I don't think I can.
But why don't we just talk about it later, in this building? Okay? All right.
But, you're great.
And you have great ideas.
And Uh Bye.
Bye, babe.
Hey, I brought this cholesterol testing kit for the health thing.
Okay, let's do it.
So, I asked Ben out to dinner and he said no.
What? Yeah.
He seemed really into you.
What did he say exactly? He was like, "Huh? What? Uh Bye.
" And then, he walked into an office that wasn't his.
You know what? If he doesn't want to go out with you, he's nuts.
You're awesome, and there's a million other guys out there.
I have been having so much fun just dating a bunch of people.
I know.
Who was that guy you were talking to out there? And then also kissing? I was Crap on a crayfish.
That really stings.
I haven't pricked you, yet.
Oh, sorry.
I was just picturing it.
You know what? Maybe you need to cast a wider net.
Have you thought about Internet dating? Really? I don't think that's for me.
You're a monster.
Still haven't done it, yet.
You know what? I'll help you set up a profile.
It'll be fun.
All right.
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay.
Good.
I'm glad that's over.
Oh, it's not.
you, Ann! Who the hell is Forp? I don't know.
I couldn't really hear him.
It sounded like his name was Forp.
Get his number? No.
Good girl.
Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate.
Hey, I'm just gonna pop over to Grain 'N Simple to get the very best ingredients for my burger.
Do you wanna come? What is Grain 'N Simple? It's a health food store.
Pawnee doesn't have a health food store.
No, but Snerling does.
And it's only a 40-minute drive.
What are you doing, Andy? I'm getting healthier snacks for the shoeshine stand.
Chris is a food genius.
Did you know that the food you eat becomes energy? Yeah.
Boom.
That's spaghetti.
Nachos.
That's a cookie.
That's my husband.
See you tomorrow? Okay.
Is that a different guy from earlier? What? Never mind.
You ready to rock this profile? All right.
Yellow-haired female.
Likes waffles and news.
Sexy, well-read blonde.
Loves the sweeter things in life.
Much better.
Hobbies? Organizing my agenda.
Wait, that doesn't sound fun.
Jamming on my planner.
Favorite place? Upstairs, there is this mural of wildflowers.
And I like to sit on a bench in front of it.
Really? It could be anywhere in the world.
Paris, Hawaii, the Grand Canyon.
Nope.
Just the bench in front of the mural.
What about, like, an actual meadow where wildflowers are? Eww, Ann.
I'm scared of bees.
Mural.
Okay.
What do you think of dogs? Love.
Cats? Love.
Fish? Love.
Turtles? No opinion.
They're condescending.
Describe your ideal man.
He's dark and mysterious.
And he can sing.
And he plays the organ.
I think you just described the Phantom of the Opera.
Hmm.
Ah, Nirvana.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Chris.
Amber.
Annie.
Bill.
Johnny.
No.
I don't plan to buy anything here.
I buy my burger ingredients at Food and Stuff, a discount food outlet equidistant from my home and my work.
I came here for the same reason people go to the zoo.
Shh.
Look at that thing.
Nature is amazing.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
A 98% match? That's a soul mate-level match.
I've never seen anything this high before.
Awesome.
Okay.
I know what you're thinking.
And you know what? You have to forget about Ben.
He had his chance and he blew it.
This computer could have found the future Mr.
Leslie Knope.
Yeah.
Okay.
Entire universe of guys I might date, let's see what you got.
This is Craig at hoosiermate.
com.
How can I help you? Craig, your service is crap.
Can you be more specific? Yes.
Your soul mate match was totally wrong for me.
I mean, I like him as a friend and everything, but I'd never go out with him.
He's like a little sister to me.
We have a very sophisticated algorithm that's paired up thousands of couples.
I actually met my wife on the site.
Really? Well, that's not gonna last.
Excuse me? You heard me.
Your marriage is a sham.
Goodbye, Craig.
No, actually See you, sweetheart.
He seems nice.
Eh, he kind of lives in a barn.
What's up? What's wrong with me? Why do good guys hate me and gross guys love me? Diagnose me.
You're a nurse.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're an intelligent, classy, attractive woman.
But for whatever reason, right now, only douchey guys are buying what you're selling.
So, I should go and ask them what they think I'm selling.
A douche-vestigation.
Nice.
Hi, Joe.
I know you're gonna take this the wrong way, but can I talk to you for a second? You can do anything to me, for any number of seconds.
Hmm.
Would you like to talk outside in my van? No, here's fine.
I was flattered by what you said earlier.
And I was just wondering, what do you look for in a woman? She can't be in a wheelchair.
No canes.
No gray hair.
So, basically, you're just attracted to me because I'm not an elderly person.
Yeah.
And as I aforementioned, you have a killer dumpster.
What does this do? Would you like to sample our vegan bacon? 100% meatless.
Yes, please.
Another, please.
Sir? Is there a problem? I'm just making sure no one ever has to eat this.
I don't think I can give you any more.
I want one.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm calling to lodge a complaint about the seaweed and almond under-eye cream I purchased from you guys.
Oh, my problem is it smells terrible.
Yeah, I even mixed it with another under-eye cream and it still smelled.
So, I ruined two eye creams.
Yes, I will hold.
Forever young, I wanna be forever young Do you really wanna live forever What's this? Dragon fruit.
What's this? A kiwano, or horned melon.
What's this? A peach.
I knew that.
Wow! Fresh lettuce is my all-time favorite food.
What's your favorite food? Well, I take Skittles, and I put it between two Starbursts.
You know what I call it? Skittle sandwich? That's pretty good.
No, I call it Andy's mouth surprise.
It's nice because the flavor of the Starbursts really bring out a similar flavor in the Skittles.
Forever young I wanna be Hey, Tom.
What's up? Do you wanna go to lunch? No, I don't really feel like going to J.
J.
's.
We can go anywhere.
Your choice.
I'm buying.
Can I get apps and 'zerts? 'Zerts are what I call desserts.
Tray-trays are entrees.
I call sandwiches sammies, sandoozles, or Adam Sandlers.
Air conditioners are cool blasterz, with a Z.
I don't know where that came from.
I call cakes big ol' cookies.
I call noodles long-ass rice.
Fried chicken is fry-fry chicky-chick.
Chicken parm is chicky-chicky parm-parm.
Chicken cacciatore? Chicky catch.
I call eggs pre-birds or future birds.
Root beer is super water.
Tortillas are bean blankies.
And I call forks food rakes.
Yeah.
You can get as many 'zerts as you want.
Well, let's get in my go-go mobile.
Car.
This'll be fun.
Let's say you rub a bottle and a genie comes out and gives you three wishes.
What would those wishes be? Come on, Leslie.
This'll be a fun game.
Three wishes.
Go.
Okay.
First wish? I have a huge house with a ton of balconies.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I would just stand out there and survey my empire, like a drug dealer in a Michael Bay movie.
And I'll just spend my time out there reading my iPad and drinking espressos in a terry cloth robe.
Wish number two.
Okay.
I'm the CEO of the Spike TV network.
And my best friend slash personal assistant is Oscar winner Jamie Foxx.
And we create a raunchy animated series based on our friendship, called Tommy and the Foxx.
Okay.
We don't have to do this anymore.
No, no.
I'm into it now.
Wish number three.
They remake Point Break.
I play both roles.
Keanu and Swayze.
I think if you continue cross-training the way you have, you're gonna I don't see any ingredients.
Have you bought ingredients? Nope.
Do you need help shopping? No.
Are you hurt? Can you move? Never felt better.
Chris! Can I get these? I said one thing.
Honey? Pinwheel.
Let's play a different game.
I'm gonna say stuff about me, and you say, on a scale from 1 to 10, how interested in that thing you are.
Ready? Okay.
I love sunshine and fresh air and early-morning walks.
One.
I've read five biographies of Eleanor Roosevelt.
One.
I work at the Parks and Recreation One.
That's what you do.
One.
I once kissed a girl in college.
Eight.
Where I graduated summa cum laude in history.
One.
Zero.
Negative a billion.
Don't talk about it anymore, please.
I love Food and Stuff.
It's where I buy all of my food.
And most of my stuff.
Hey, can I get these? How much are they? Two bucks apiece.
Good deal.
Anything else? Nope.
Just the crows and the beef.
So, the only thing that's important to you is hotness? Wendy? Lucy? All you cared about was the shape of their boobs? No, I really liked them, and they happened to have nice breasts.
You're acting really weird.
What did you even buy me lunch for? Just so you could yell at me for what I like about women? Okay.
Promise not to tell anyone? Sure.
This is insane, but you and I got matched up on hoosiermate.
com.
Soul mate-level match.
You wanna date me! This is a date! This is not a date, okay? You took me to a fancy restaurant, you paid for my meal, and you're trying to get to know me better.
I was just trying to figure out why only sleazy guys are into me right now.
Nice try.
You love me.
Leslie Knope, Tom Haverford Dating in the day, dating in the night Dating all day 'cause he's keeping it tight All right, Tom.
Enough.
Dating in the car, dating on the floor Dating everywhere 'cause she wants some more What, yeah, oh, we're going to, yeah Hey, Tom, I'm just printing out these health tips.
Can you grab them for me? One second.
I'm just looking at some real estate listings.
Oh, this is perfect for us.
Three-bedroom, and Oh, God, Les.
It has that dream closet you've always wanted.
A walk-in closet.
Oh, God.
Hey, hey, boo.
What's wrong? Where did you go? Come back to me.
Stop it.
Don't disappear on me.
I need you, boo.
All right.
Let's get into it.
What do you guys have for health tips? Ben, if it's okay with you, Leslie and I are going to lead the meeting today, because of our deep spiritual connection.
Okay.
All right.
Is everything okay or Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Everything is great, Ben.
Les and I just had something magical happen today at lunch.
There is some weird juju in this room right now.
Office yoga.
We do stretches at our desk or next to our desk or in a chair.
Always good for you.
We give everyone pedometers and we have a contest.
Whoever takes the most steps wins a prize.
Anything to get their heart rate up.
You know what else gets people's heart rate up? Doing it.
Talking about sex with my boss.
Can you excuse us for a second? Yeah.
Hey.
Can I talk to you for a second? Let me get off the chair.
Hey What is wrong with you? Leslie.
It's the workplace.
You're being a little bit too feisty right now.
You are being a little bit too much of an ass right now.
Okay? Knock it off.
I can't fight this feeling anymore.
You and I, we're dating.
You should be so lucky.
Leslie.
Huh? Tom.
They should fix that.
It was all just a joke.
I can assure you, there's nothing romantic going on between me and Tom.
I have a very strict policy.
No office relationships, particularly between a supervisor and an employee.
The taxpayers pay us.
So, we can't have anything appearing even remotely scandalous.
I'm just saying, if you can't keep your mouth to yourself, I'm gonna have to suspend you.
I understand.
Look.
Cucumber flower.
Wow, that's so cute.
Wait, that's a garnish.
You're not supposed to eat that.
What? So, just type up those ones we talked about, and we'll get it finalized tomorrow.
Yep.
Hey, Tom.
Yeah.
What was all that stuff with you and Leslie? Girl likes Indian food.
What can I say? Fine.
We got matched up on an online dating site.
And I was messing with her, she got pissed.
So, she took me out in the hallway and kissed me, out of revenge.
Really? And as much as it pains me to admit this, it was not disgusting.
Okay.
Well, I don't need the details or anything.
I'm just saying.
She knows what to do.
All right.
Like, I was impressed.
Yeah.
It was stirring.
Goodbye.
It felt like Yeah.
All right.
Just Anyway, like I was saying I humbly place before you my east-meets-west patented Traeger Turkey Burger, an Asian-fusion burger made with Willow Farms organic turkey, a toasted taleggio cheese crisp, papaya chutney, black truffle aioli, and microgreens on a gluten-free brioche bun.
Enjoy.
Mmm.
Mmm.
This tastes as delicious as Beyoncé smells.
I'm guessing.
What is this in here? Saffron? Wow! Somebody's got a sharp palate.
I love the umami flavor.
Stop being so pretentious, Kyle.
Sorry.
Here's mine.
It's a hamburger, made out of meat, on a bun, with nothing.
Add ketchup if you want.
I couldn't care less.
Ron, I am so disappointed.
I thought that you and I were gonna have a real challenge.
Never mind.
This is better.
Way better.
Mmm.
Yep.
Mmm-hmm.
Kyle? Sorry, Andy.
Ron's is better.
Damn it, Kyle.
Oh, my God.
It's so much better, it's crazy.
Turkey can never beat cow, Chris.
Sorry.
Well, I don't understand.
I've tinkered with this recipe for years.
Granted, it's been a long time since I've had a hamburger.
This is better.
The commissary will continue to serve horrifying, artery-clogging hamburgers.
Man.
We spent, like, 50 hours working on those burgers.
I know.
Hard work never pays off.
Cooking is dumb.
I swear on this dead crow that I will never cook for you.
I love you.
I just wanted to make sure that there were no hard feelings after I forced you to break up with Tom.
Oh, we weren't No.
No hard feelings.
'Cause it's just a real bugaboo of mine.
And it applies to everyone.
Just the other day, Ben told me that he might want to socialize with somebody from the government and I said, "I'm sorry.
Not possible.
" Really? Did he say who? No, and I didn't ask.
Because it's irrelevant.
He oversees every department.
It simply can't happen.
This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten.
Mmm.
And it's so bad for me.
I'm gonna have to jog while I digest this.
Excuse me.
Hey.
What's up? Hey.
Well, I think I'm allergic to chutney.
Also, what's chutney? No clue.
Yeah.
Hey, I never got to tell you the rest of my ideas.
You wanna go somewhere and talk about them? Yeah.
Yeah, I'd love to.
Let me get some actual food, and then, do you know that wildflower mural up on the second floor? Mmm-hmm.
Yeah? You wanna meet there? Yeah.
Okay.
Sounds good.
I don't know if the online thing is for me.
I prefer to meet people in person.
It's like door number two on Let's Make a Deal.
Do you want the thing that you have, that you know you like, but isn't perfect, or do you give it up for what's behind door number two? I think I like what I have.
I'm gonna try to make it work with Tom.
I'm kidding! All right, be honest, Tom.
How did you and I get matched up? I made 26 profiles, each designed to attract a different type of girl.
Tom A.
Haverford.
Sporty and sexy.
Tom B.
Haverford, smooth and soulful.
Which letter did you get? N, Tom N.
Haverford.
The N stands for nerd! I never even check that one, 'cause no one ever responds to it.
Okay.
Well, whatever.
Tom N.
Haverford collects globes.
Great.
That's enough.
His favorite movie is books.
Donna? Every time I want you to shut up, from now on.
Good morning, Ben.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Did I scare you? No.
I just wanted to remind you of the art show that's happening tonight at the community center.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Great.
Well, that sounds cool.
That sounds like something that will be a big success.
You know? I mean, like everything that you put your paws on.
Your fingers.
Leslie Knope! Ben Wyatt.
Ben, great news.
Do you remember the woman I told you about from the county commissioner's office? Um Vaguely.
Sure you do.
Cindy Miller.
Anyway, she's agreed to go out on a date with you.
Oh.
You asked her out for me? You're going to love her.
She is interesting, smart and beautiful.
Inside and out.
Inner beauty is very important.
And outer beauty is also very important.
I thought you had a rule about inter-government relationships.
Don't worry.
Her department is completely separate from ours.
This isn't anything like your affair with Tom Haverford.
We weren't You You I'm sorry, who are you calling? Cindy Miller.
Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger.
Guess who is standing in this room with me right now.
Oh, uh Ben Wyatt.
Ben, say hello.
Hi, Cindy.
Sorry.
Hi.
No apology necessary.
It's just Chris being Chris.
How are you doing? Ooh! Sparks are flying! We may have to call the fire department.
It's a government joke.
I love setting people up.
Here's my secret.
I determine someone's best qualities, and then, I find someone else with compatible qualities, and I bring them together.
God, this sucks.
Why don't you just go home for the rest of the day? I can't go home, because I have this art show opening at the community center, and I can't stay here because I see Ben, and I can't date Ben because of Chris' stupid rules.
I feel so Powerless.
Yeah.
I'm like that light bulb.
Weak, flickering, barely giving off any light, unable to make out with the light bulb I want to make out with.
You know what might make you feel better? A hug? Paxil.
Do you want me to get you a prescription? Hey, Tom! A question for you.
Do you know anyone who's looking for a roommate? How hot? I What? How hot is the woman that's looking for a place to stay? No, it's me.
I'm looking.
Come on.
That's not fair.
You shouldn't have led me to believe it was a beautiful woman.
I didn't.
I've been staying at the Pawnee Super Suites Motel for seven months.
It's a charming little inn with wonderfully random wake-up calls, delightfully unstable temperatures, and, as of yesterday, bedbugs.
"Four stars," says nobody.
I wish I could help you, Benihana, but I can't.
I have a one-bedroom.
I can't have a dude sleeping on my couch if and when I bring home a lady.
I have a ritual, and it starts on the couch.
We sit down, clap my hands, lights dim.
Okay.
I understand.
Boyz II Men.
Fades in.
Please, stop.
No.
No, you don't need to explain the ritual.
I'm good.
You know who might be able to help out a homeless dude such as yourself? This is awesomely perfect.
Burly just moved in with his rich girlfriend, and we need help with the rent.
We have a couple of house rules, though.
Yeah, sure.
Of course.
You can't use the front door.
You have to climb in through the back window.
No personal phone conversations.
If you ever speak to me in Spanish, please use the formal "usted".
And no electricity after 6:00 p.
m.
She's joking.
Okay.
You can use as much free electricity as you want.
It's free.
Couple more rules.
If you ever watch a sad movie, you have to wear mascara so we can see whether or not you've been crying.
There's no noise allowed on Mondays, and no TV after breakfast.
She is lying again.
She is.
Yes.
Because it's hard to tell.
No.
We leave the TV on all day long so burglars think that we're home when we're not, which was my idea that I'm trying to patent.
So, you want to move in tonight? Yeah.
Sure.
That would be great.
You want my gum? Uh-huh.
Ron, can you make the opening remarks? I'm just I'm not in the mood.
Neither am I.
Ever.
What's wrong with you? You live for this kind of stuff.
I don't have it in me right now.
Ron, please.
Do it for me.
Make the speech.
Ron, please.
Please.
Give the speech, Ron.
No.
Yes.
Please? Ron? Please.
No.
Please give the speech.
Please give the speech.
No.
I won't.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No way.
Please, please, please, please, please.
No.
Please, please.
Yes, yes All right! Damn it, woman.
Okay, everyone.
Shut up and look at me! Welcome to "Visions of Nature.
" This room has several paintings in it.
Some are big.
Some are small.
People did them, and they are here now.
I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings.
Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.
I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.
Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further.
End of speech.
And that's the TV room.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, it's a mess.
Can you throw that in the trash can? I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding.
What happened? Well, Burly moved out.
He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.
Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago.
You guys made this mess in a week? Well, I always think April's going to clean up.
And I never clean up.
It's cute, right? No.
Yes, it is.
Are you guys frying marbles? We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.
It doesn't.
The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.
I think we found that in Ben.
You forgot to paint a painting, son.
So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag.
It's stunning.
It's breathtaking, Jerry.
Yeah.
It really is.
Wow.
Thanks, guys.
Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting.
Oh, my God.
That's me.
Is that me? What? No.
Geez, it does look like you.
You're just realizing that now? That's what you see when you close your eyes at night, Jerry.
Topless Leslie glued to a horse.
Okay.
Leslie, I am just so, so sorry.
Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to take it right down.
No.
Leave it up.
I love it.
I don't know how to explain it.
Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, "What can't that centaur woman do? "Besides ride an escalator and drive a car.
" Art can be so magnificent.
Oh, my God.
The baby is Tom.
What? This is easily my favorite painting ever.
What the hell, Jerry? Look at my pot belly.
I look like a pregnant baby.
And why am I so scared? All right, we've got to take this down.
Now.
No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom.
It's staying right here.
Hello, fellow lover of the arts.
Welcome to the painting.
What, is that you? Well, it's hot.
Thank you.
This guy's in it, too.
He's the little fat baby.
Cool.
Yeah.
What's going on right here? Baby rolls! We've been trying to get that light fixed for months.
Thank you.
Thank her.
Good morning, Tom.
She marched into my office this morning and told me she wouldn't leave until I got this done.
Hmm.
Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good.
They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.
In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the Jay-Z vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe.
Hey, Aphrodite.
Chris needs you in his office.
Hmm.
When you're done with the light, fix the printer.
I don't know how to fix printers.
Learn it.
Leslie, should I go, too? This isn't about you, Jerry.
It's my painting.
Why am I upset? Let's start with government-funded animal porn.
I'm not sure that's fair.
I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality.
Bestiality? It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse.
And how did it get like that? Who had sex with what and gave birth to which? Ms.
Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution.
Destroy it.
Destroy it? I mean, is she serious? Do you find this personally offensive? Not personally, no.
No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form.
I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
I've posed nude.
In college, I was in a nude production of Cats.
But I am not in the nude now, am I? Because we're in a government building.
And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying.
So, take care of this situation.
That painting is not going to be destroyed.
Every great work of art contains a message.
And the message of this painting is, "Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia.
" Morning, roomie.
How did you sleep? Well, there were no bedbugs.
Also, no bed.
I'm going to go buy a bed.
Fork.
I'm sorry.
Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee? Yeah.
It's pretty cute, right? No.
Do you know what "cute" means? What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast? What have you guys got against washing dishes? We don't have any dishes, okay? Burly took them all when he left.
Now, I bet you feel like a jerk.
God.
Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore.
No.
Sorry, dude.
We already spent your money on a new Xbox 360 and more frisbees to eat off of.
You've got to stay.
God.
Okay.
All right.
Here's the deal.
We're going to clean this place up.
Okay? And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults.
Cool.
We'll get to be adults.
Gee, golly.
Thanks, mister.
Fork.
Hello.
I'm Perd Hapley, and welcome to Ya' Heard? With Perd.
Today's show begins now.
Is this art or is it pornography? Here to answer this question is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director, Leslie Knope.
Perd, it is a beautiful work of art.
Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one.
But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.
You are the subject of this painting.
Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts.
I am not the subject.
The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.
But it does look a little bit like me.
Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real? No.
Absolutely sure? Okay.
So, you always separate your lights from your darks.
That's racist.
And then, you get your laundry Where is your laundry detergent? Right.
Here we are.
Okay.
This is bubble bath.
You guys You wash your clothes in bubble bath? Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing.
No, it's not.
Well, they both make bubbles, so It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.
Okay.
Also joining us today is a different person.
Pornographic film actress, Brandi Maxxxx.
Pleasure to be here.
Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good.
When did you get into the business? Last year.
Fantastic.
Now, this painting right here, art or pornography? Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous.
What Leslie and I do is obviously art.
Hang on.
There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.
It's okay, Leslie.
I got this one.
What? What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.
Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or Yep.
what have you.
Okay.
Hang on.
Pornography is very difficult to define.
In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, "I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.
" Brandi, how would you define pornography? For me, it's when the penis goes in.
All right, we need to do some basic organization.
Where do you put your bills when they come? I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.
Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.
Why? So they won't get lost.
Bingo.
Okay, you have to pay these.
Good thing I didn't lose them.
Okay.
New lesson.
Basic finance.
I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.
Okay.
I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.
Bank account.
Good.
Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford.
I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.
I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.
You look familiar to me.
Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.
I'm a part-owner there.
That's you.
In the painting.
You're the fat baby.
Aw! That's so cute.
Oh.
You're into that? No.
Damn it, Jerry.
Imagine my horror.
I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.
I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed.
Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film.
I urge you not to take that role.
I am not going to take the role.
That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable.
I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.
Thank you, Leslie.
Stand down, Jerry.
This isn't your fight.
You've left me no choice.
I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision.
Fine with me.
Public Arts Commission.
Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.
Jackpot.
Good morning, Ron.
Morning.
I know how much you enjoy paperwork, but don't hover.
Nice bench.
Is that new? No, that's been there since the '90s.
What are you doing for your birthday on Friday? Nothing.
I never Aha! Oh, God.
Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.
He's even had it redacted on all government documents.
Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well-placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday.
Damn it.
I was so careful.
Well, you blew it.
All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.
Was it worth it, Ron? Was it? I command you to do nothing.
I'm not gonna do nothing.
I'm gonna do something.
And it's gonna be really big.
I have a lot of years to make up for.
I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me.
Plus, the whole thing is a scam.
Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
They put up a fence.
Who? No! What's that? There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.
There's even a security guard.
You got to show Eagleton I.
D.
to get in.
Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.
And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.
With a Harman Kardon Logic Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground? Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay.
Who? Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.
We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.
Then she went to work in Eagleton and "fixed her deviated septum" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else.
What was it again? Oh, yeah.
Her soul.
Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side? To be fair, yeah.
Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.
But it has a lot of heart.
That's what people always say when something sucks.
We should stand up for our town, okay? Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier.
People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.
I would never set foot over there.
But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days.
Okay, well, I am on "Operation No More Fence," so I'm putting you in charge of "Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe.
" I am all over it.
I just need you to do what's on that list.
Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.
But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
It's the only park in our neighborhood.
I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry? There's rocks in there.
Why don't we just set fire to the fence? You know, set it ablaze.
That's arson.
Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers.
The point is, it would work.
Why don't we build a fence around their fence? Why? It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught.
My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm.
You need to get those people to tear that fence down.
This woman's right.
I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence.
Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down.
But whatever you guys think.
Yeah.
Great.
Yes, hi.
I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.
Do those come in different sizes? I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.
Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats? That was rude.
Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately.
I was just talking on the phone.
To whom? It was personal.
I would never make a work-related call.
You know that.
Lindsay! Leslie Knope.
Hi.
Hi.
Has it really been five years? It has.
You look amazing.
Thank you.
This place hasn't changed a bit.
Still loveable, but grimy.
Hello, there.
I'm Ben Wyatt.
I'm assistant city manager Hi, Dan.
Ben.
It's not important.
It won't come up again.
This is Ann.
She is my best friend.
Hi.
Now.
And she's a nurse, and she works at a hospital.
Oh.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.
It's just, nursing You must be so tired and sad.
It's really nice outside.
Shall we speak in my courtyard? Yeah.
Well, thank you so much for stopping by.
I was passing through Pawnee anyway.
I do a lot of charity work here.
There's only so much you can do.
You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day.
Oh.
Look at that.
Let me get a closer look.
So let's talk about Lafayette Park.
Oh, yes.
The fence.
I'm only trying to protect our children.
Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you.
When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone.
That's what makes them so great.
You know what's really great? A private park that's not for everyone.
Wowsers.
What do you care? It's just a crappy little park.
Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas.
Hmm.
And that someone was this woman.
You can take it if you want.
I have many copies and the negatives.
And I have a JPEG.
The fence stays up.
Lindsay, if we Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up.
But it was good seeing you.
What? I'm not asleep.
I'm awake.
I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you.
That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.
What did I say instead? Wow! This is where they have their public forums? Yeah, it's not that great.
They had a valet.
Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee.
And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
But their people are not inherently better than our people.
The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income.
Who cares? Factoid alert.
Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.
Pawnee was established in May of 1817.
And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton.
Hello, Pawnee.
Welcome to our public forum.
Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford.
Okay.
Well, nice outfit.
What, did you just come from the stables? Yes.
I was just at the stables.
You look like you've been working hard.
You have a million fly-aways right now.
Would you like to borrow a mirror or a self-help book? I would not.
I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay.
Pun intended.
You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there.
Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it.
The forum is beginning.
We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you.
Great.
Look how pretty the people are.
Hey, Ron.
How's the street parking at your house? What? Can you handle, like, 20 cars or a double-decker party bus? There is no street parking at my house.
My house is not even on a street.
Do you have space for, like, a huge circus tent? Hey, Ron.
Have you seen What the hell? No! Oh! Well, looks like there won't be any balloons for the birthday boy.
These were for a sick child at the hospital.
My office, now.
I don't work for you.
Don't care.
Decisions, decisions.
I think I'm gonna go with the porcini mushrooms and boursin, s'il vous plaît.
that the Eagleton-Pawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.
Hello.
I'm Bertram Rolands, a citizen of Eagleton.
With all due respect, Ms.
Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there? Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now.
Hello.
I'm Christine Porter.
I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.
I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.
Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status.
Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett.
Joey, wave to the audience.
Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence.
I can wave with this arm.
No, you can't.
Both your arms are broken.
All due respect, I recognize that boy.
He was caught selling fireworks to Eagleton kids.
Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town.
You cannot be sure that he is the one.
This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.
Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves.
Thanks to Leslie Knope.
I'm not done.
Isn't she trying her hardest? So cute and so good.
I'm only gonna ask you this once.
What is going on with my birthday? Oh, my God.
Ron, it's your birthday.
Happy Birthday.
Shut your damn mouth.
This is a fun conversation.
Just tell me what Leslie is planning.
Honestly, I don't know.
I haven't heard anything.
Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday? Oh, well, that was intense.
She totally surprised me.
She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Señor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out.
They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings "Happy Birthday"? Damn it.
And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger.
Ugh.
Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming.
And then there was a bouncy castle.
Did you know they made those for adults? Mmm-hmm.
Maybe I'll change it up this time.
Can I try the andouille sausage? Tom, let's go.
What? No.
Hey, not you too.
It's gross.
I don't like it.
It's disgusting.
Did you guys get your public forum gift bag? There's an iPod touch in here.
Man, she used to not be like this.
Eagleton really changed her.
Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway? Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job.
And you said no? Are you insane? I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live.
And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared.
Wow.
Verbena-scented soy candles! You want me to do what, now? Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment, a conference or something, and make her take April and freeze their bank accounts.
I don't understand.
Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory? No, it has nothing to do with her work.
I don't want to get into it.
Ron, look, this is me, okay? You know you can talk to me about anything.
Well, it's my birthday on Friday.
Hey! Happy Birthday.
I'm ending this right now.
I'm just gonna leave early and go home.
Unless That's exactly what she wants me to do.
All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there.
What are you doing? Eagleton treats us like garbage.
We're gonna treat them like garbage.
We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park.
And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.
Well, isn't that just playing right into what they think of you? Oh, my God.
What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.
Put everything back in the truck.
Let's back it up.
No, no, no, no.
Leslie, you promised we could throw garbage everywhere.
Wow.
I didn't expect to see the whole Parks Department here, although it is, sadly, one of the nicest spots in town.
I am so sick of this, Lindsay.
Wait, Leslie.
I've got this.
You listen to me, Lindsay Carlisle Shay.
Why don't you take your fancy dog, get in your Escalade, and if you have any job openings, maybe you should let me know about 'em.
Come on, man.
No! I'm sick of being treated like I'm not willing to relocate to Eagleton, because I am! So here's what you could do, lady.
Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.
Oh, yeah! Shove it there! No.
You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget.
You're a Pawnee girl.
No, Leslie, I'm not.
Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.
J.
's Diner? It's not for me.
These waffles make great dog laxatives.
Don't you dare feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop.
Sambuca need to make? There you go.
Leslie.
How dare you? No! - Get her, Leslie! No! Garbage fight! Ugh! 
I need you guys to come to the Snakehole Lounge tonight to help me with something.
Yeah, no, tonight's not good.
No can do.
I'm on a cleanse.
Please.
This is important.
I'm launching my new high-end, Kahlua-style liqueur, Snake Juice.
Sounds like you took a snake and twisted it like a rag until its blood and guts came out.
What does Kahlua-style mean? I mix a bunch of alcohol together, I add some sugar and coffee and some other junk, and it kind of tastes like Kahlua.
I can only drink warm tap water with cayenne pepper.
Fine.
Then don't drink it.
Just get other people to drink it, okay? Meeting in one hour.
If you don't make it, you're on my Done-zo list.
What's a "Done-zo list"? It means you and I are done-zo.
Hanging out, getting food together, done-zo.
You want to come over to my house and play video games? Done-zo.
Hey, Tom, you want to come play Putt-Putt with me? No, we're done-zo.
Babe, we got to make that meeting.
All right, let's start with the personal stuff.
How's Jessie? Who? The photographer guy.
Oh, yeah.
We broke up.
I didn't tell you that? Uh-uh.
Why? I liked him.
Yeah, I did, too.
I just I couldn't deal with his face.
Do you think I could get that book back that I loaned him? Oh, well, I'm technically out of the country.
So I would have to call him from a weird number.
Sorry.
Oh.
Never mind.
But I'm seeing this new guy, Mattias.
You would love him.
He's a triple Pisces.
Oh, looks like someone's gonna be late for her meeting.
Race you.
Really? Isn't that a little childish? Bye, Ann.
Sorry, got to go.
Hey, move! Councilman Howser, sorry.
Nice to see you as always.
Bye.
Welcome to Guerilla Marketing 101.
What is Guerilla Marketing? A few ordinary schmoes, no offense, have a casual conversation next to some guy about how great Snake Juice is.
Next thing you know that guy orders a whole bottle of Snake Juice, and he has no idea why.
Ron is going to play our exciting Snake Juice drinker, A.
K.
A.
Brian Thunder.
Jerry, you'll be playing a boring beer drinker.
Your name will be Jerry.
Your talking points are high-end, VIP, lifestyle.
All right, let's run through it once.
And action! "The weather has been so weird lately.
"Hey, let me buy you all a drink.
" "I'll take something basic like a beer.
" "Yeah, I'm pretty "boring.
"So I'll take a beer, too.
" "Not me.
I want this night to get K-razzy.
" "Ca-razy.
" Like "crazy.
" "I want this night to get crazy.
"Get me a shot of Snake Juice.
I hear it has a dope aftertaste.
" All right, that's gonna be a cut.
Um Ron, you got to say it like you mean it.
I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it.
My only official recommendations are U.
S.
Army-issued mustache trimmers, Morton Salt, and the C.
R.
Laurence Fein two-inch, axe-style scraper oscillating knife blade.
We need to find a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Dennis Cooper was fired today.
Why? Short answer, he went bananas.
Long answer, his wife, Jan, had an affair, gave him a venereal disease, and so he put signs about her all through City Hall.
I'm sure you've seen them.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
"Jan Cooper will give you Chlamydia.
"Brought to you by the Pawnee Health Department.
" "Chlamydia affects nearly 100% of Jan Coopers.
" "The Department of Health congratulates Jan Cooper.
"Miss Chlamydia.
" "Jan, I love you.
Please come back.
"I realize that I'm not blameless here.
"Please.
"Brought to you by the Health Department.
" "Re-elect Jan Cooper.
Mayor of Whoreville.
" Leslie, I want you to help us choose a replacement.
Parks and Health work closely together on outdoor programs and exercise initiatives.
Ann should do it.
Ann Perkins? Pawnee is looking for a new PR Director for the Health Department, and I submitted your name.
You have an interview tomorrow at 9:00 a.
m.
Yes, I know.
I couldn't get it earlier.
I'm Grateful.
I know.
You can thank me later.
But first, you need to go over your homework.
These are all the health initiatives the city has ever undertaken since the 1960s.
So you need to partially memorize that.
And it's gonna be a long night, so I got you some energy drinks and some chocolate-covered espresso beans and the book Freedom by Jonathan Franzen.
Why am I reading this? Because I'm almost done with it, Ann.
And I want to talk to you about Patty.
Okay, deep breath.
Okay.
I've been a nurse for over 10 years.
It's not something you just quit.
I understand.
I just think with this new job, you could make a difference.
Make real change happen.
Plus, we'd be working in the same building.
No more lightning-round catch-up sessions.
It would be nice to have an office.
And let's be honest, it would be nice to not have to pull strange things out of people's butts every night.
You've mentioned that before.
That doesn't happen that often.
It happened once.
Just once.
That already is too many times.
I hate talking to people about things.
This is a nightmare.
I'm grouchy.
Well, we have to support Tom.
Think about it as role-playing.
That makes it sexy.
That could be fun.
Really? Can I use a weird voice and try to freak people out? Yes.
Okay.
Then next time you see me, I'll be a stranger.
Snake Juice! What? Here? High-end, VIP, exclusive.
Hey, how's it going? I think it's going okay.
People better buy this stuff, or else I'm gonna be screwed.
It's gonna be fine.
People will definitely buy it.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
"K" to the "N" to the "O-P-E," she's the dopest little shorty in all Pawnee, Indiana Why didn't you just stop at "Pawnee"? Leslie Knope, seriously, you get sexier every day.
And that is not a line.
That is for real.
Oh, Jean-Ralphio.
Well, I know tonight's gonna be a big success, and I wish I could stay.
I really do, but I have to go help Ann.
She's gonna be up all night cramming for a big job interview.
She might be up all night, but I think someone else is gonna be doing the cramming.
Uh-oh! Hey.
Hey.
I'm so happy to see you.
And I'm seeing you here.
Yes.
Yes, I'm surprised.
I thought maybe you'd be home preparing for tomorrow.
Oh, well, there was way too much stuff for me to read tonight, anyway.
I mean, it was a ridiculous amount of stuff that you gave me.
Oh.
But you are going in for the interview tomorrow? I think so.
Uh-oh.
Is there enough room for some "man-aise" in this lady sandwich? Oh.
Leslie, this is my friend Howard Tuttleman.
Oh, please.
Call me "The Douche.
" You probably know me from my morning radio show on 93.
7, "Crazy Ira and The Douche.
" Yeah, I had met you before.
I actually was on your show once Wait! Were you on the show where we had that stripper do math? Classic, right? Hello, strange person who I have never met before.
Who are you? I'm Janet Snakehole.
I'm a very rich widow with a terrible secret.
Who are you? Bert Macklin, FBI.
I was the best damn agent they had until I was framed for a crime I didn't commit.
Stealing the President's rubies.
Now I work alone.
Lovely to meet you.
I got to admit, I thought your costume would maybe be a little bit sluttier.
How dare you? Nice.
Gentlemen.
Swan song.
How you living? Yes.
Why aren't you holding a Snake Juice? I'm more of a whiskey man.
Ron-Ron, come here.
Come here for a bit.
You're good right there.
Listen, you got to jump on the Tommy Town Express.
This guy has some of the best investment ideas I've ever heard in my life.
Make a baby tuxedo clothing line.
A department store with a guest list.
White fur ear muffs for men.
Contact lenses that display text messages.
Invent a phone that smells good.
Own a night club called Eclipse that's only open for one hour two times a year.
Cover charge, $5,000.
I can keep going.
How about this, Ron? Try Snake Juice.
If you like it, you got to talk it up all night.
If you don't, I'll shave Jean-Ralphio's head.
Yeah, I'd like to see that.
Hit me.
A lot riding on this.
Damn, if that isn't delicious.
"R" to the "O" to the "N" I say Swanson's got swagger the size of a Big Ben clock Dude, you got to end it on the rhyme.
I know what I have to do.
You had it at "Ben.
" I know.
I got it.
You think I haven't been around the world? I've been everywhere, darling.
I'm a very wealthy woman.
My husband's kept me in the finest clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, you see.
Freeze! FBI! No! Leave me alone! Hands in the air! I didn't kill anybody! And I didn't burn down the mill either.
My sister did.
But now she's been eaten by wolves! Nothing to see here.
So how did you two meet? We met at the supermarket.
I used my classic pickup line.
"If you're looking for douches, they're in Aisle Me.
" Awesome.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think I can get that book back from what's -his-name.
Oh, that's okay.
I mean, I should've known better than to loan something to one of your boyfriends.
They come and go so fast.
What are you saying exactly? Well, I mean, let's be honest.
How long is it gonna last with this guy? Sitting right here.
I don't know.
He's dumb, but he's fun.
Thank you.
I mean, that's the whole point of dating around is you get to try on a bunch of different hats.
Well, this hat is an idiot.
Classic.
Leslie, are you mad that I came here? What? No.
I'm not Are you You seem mad at me.
No, I'm not I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at all.
Neither am I.
No.
Looks like you two need to kiss and make up.
All right.
Hello.
My name is Ron Swanson.
In general, I try never to speak with people, but I have been drinking this Snake Juice thing, and it's damn good.
You should buy it.
Yeah, okay.
Thanks, man.
Son, you should know that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee.
Drink this, now.
Traegermeister! You made it.
Yeah, I got your email.
We need to talk.
First off, though, try a little Snake Juice.
It's 140 proof, which means it's 70% alcohol.
But don't worry.
There's plenty of caffeine in it to keep you awake.
I believe an ounce of that would literally kill me.
You emailed everyone at City Hall and told them to come to a club that you own to buy alcohol that you invented.
Government employees can't use their power to enhance their personal wealth.
I totally get your point, Chris.
It won't happen again.
I just don't see any way around it.
You're gonna have to sell your shares in the Snakehole.
No! T-Pain, this guy bothering you? This is my boss.
Okay, yeah.
You want me to write a rap about your name? Yes.
"B" to the "O" to the double "S," do what he say, and you'll be successful No offense, but maybe you think I'm going too fast 'cause you're going too slow with Ben.
No offense, but I'm going slow because I might lose my job.
Okay, no offense, but maybe that's a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings.
No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings.
Offense! That's rude.
I'm gonna go dance.
Douche, you're up.
Hey, are you okay? I heard yelling.
Yeah, I'm very angry, and I'm really drunk.
Do you want to dance with me? Go get me another "Snork Juice.
" Oh, that's maybe not the best idea for you.
Forget it.
Jean-Ralphio! Yes, I'm here.
Dance up on me.
Yes, yes, yes.
This is my first fight with Ann, and it's a doozy.
But I believe that honest discussions between friends can lead to deeper intimacy.
This is a watershed moment in our relationship, and it's important that we fight clean.
All I need to do is focus and stay calm.
You're stupid, and you're drunk and you're stupid.
I don't understand how this is my fault.
It's not Everything isn't your fault all the time.
Don't always make everything your fault.
Good! It's not all my fault.
I'm not the stupid jerk.
I'm not the one who's being a stupid jerk right now.
I didn't mean it like that.
You know I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant you were being stupid, and you were acting like a jerk.
Look, I'm sorry that I thought about you for the job, okay? But sometimes if I don't push you in the right direction, you end up standing still.
I was just trying to do you a favor.
Enough with your favors, okay? Stop.
Maybe we shouldn't work together, then.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Every time I cleanse, I can literally feel the toxins leaving my body.
I know! I feel so much healthier.
I've still got a full week to go before the broth stage.
Pre-broth is an amazing stage.
It's when you're most alert.
Good.
Someone needs to be alert tonight.
This Snake Juice is basically rat poison.
Everybody's wasted.
You don't even know one thing.
I didn't even say one thing.
And then she asked me the whole thing, and I didn't even do it once.
I'm like an elephant, okay? If I walk into a room, it's like, okay, he's in there.
Bababooey.
Turn this music down.
Farts and poop and love and stuff Macaroni salad Is this everybody? Ann took a cab.
Tom's in the trunk.
Jerry's on the roof.
All right, where to first? Your mother's butt.
I'm so alone.
If even one of you thinks about dry-heaving in my car, you're all walking home.
Leslie.
I'm here.
We have to go hire a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Oh, my God.
I'm so hung over.
I've never been this hung over.
I feel great.
I ran five k this morning.
Really? No, I threw up in the shower.
Top of the morning, everyone.
I brought some burgers and fries.
Eat up.
The protein soaks up the sugar.
First, you take the cow to the killing floor Well, I am out of questions.
Thank you.
We will let you know.
Then our heads will explode, and we will die.
Oh, God.
I cannot believe that fight I had with Ann.
Look, I'm sure you guys can work it out.
I owe her, like, a million apologies.
I think I owe you one, too.
I'm sorry.
For what? I don't know.
Are you okay? No, I'm sad.
Say, thanks, chum.
I'll get those papers delivered for you.
Whatever.
Post-haste.
The doctor says it's probably not serious, but it might be.
Oh, Kyle, please stop talking.
Why, isn't it Bert Macklin? What are you doing here, and who is this sorry charlie? I'm Janet Snakehole.
I demand answers, and I want them now.
Honey, please.
I love you.
No offense, but Bert Macklin died last night after the tenth shot of Snake Juice.
Okay, sorry.
Miss Snakehole.
You think I'd let you get away that easily? Bert Macklin may be dead, but I'm his brother Kip Hackman.
Why wouldn't you have his same last name? Shut up, Kyle.
I know you boosted those paintings.
Maybe it was me, but I'll never tell you where they are.
And you'll never have my body either.
Sorry to hear the news, Tom.
We're gonna miss you around the club.
Hey, you own shares, too.
Why didn't Chris make you sell? 'Cause Chris doesn't know.
You know what? Snitches get stitches.
Donna, come on.
Don't.
I'm a natural moneymaker.
I got into government for the connections.
This was supposed to be a thing that led to the other thing.
It's like when Vin did Boiler Room.
That's what led to him being xXx and doing Furious.
And Furious.
Yeah, I know.
Listen, I don't like all this negativity, man.
Why don't you turn that "frizz-own" "upside-dizzity.
" Huh? This sucks, man.
You're wearing snow pants.
I got home last night, and I thought I might go sledding.
Can I come in? Yeah, if you're quiet.
Okay.
Uh, Leslie doesn't know I'm here.
Oh, God.
So high school.
I can't believe that Leslie and I got drunk in a bar and fought about boys.
We're so much better than that.
I just keep having flashes of things that we said to each other.
And she's so important to me.
I feel like such a dick.
I know she feels awful.
I mean, technically, we all do.
Yeah.
What the hell is in Snake Juice, Demerol? All I know is Leslie's always talking about how lucky she is to have you as a friend.
And I just wanted you to know that.
You're nice.
I can see why she likes you.
When did she say Likes me? Oh, God.
This is so high school.
Just rent a limo, ask her to the prom.
I'm sure she'll say yes.
All right.
Thanks.
So let me get this straight.
Tom tries to get off the government teat, and we punish him.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.
I wish there was something we could do.
Ben, is there something we can do? Damn it.
Ben's not here.
Tom's not scamming anyone.
He's not savvy enough to manipulate the system like that.
He's just a kid chasing a goofy dream.
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.
Jan Cooper was a terrible wife.
I just want everybody to know that.
Thank you, Dennis.
But we can't give you your job back.
You sound just like her.
That was unpleasant.
Yeah.
All right, who's next? You came.
Yeah, I had some encouragement.
Your sweater's on inside out.
And backwards.
It's been a tough morning.
Lots of regret and shame.
That should be the official slogan for Snake Juice.
Well, this committee would like to ask if you are the kind of candidate who could forgive someone after they've behaved like a complete jackass? This candidate could, especially because this candidate also behaved like a total jackass.
Please, don't worry about it.
The committee totally understands.
Also, I can talk about my qualifications for this position.
But first, I am gonna go throw up in a wastebasket.
Would you mind if I joined you? Not at all.
Shall we? Ann came in the next day and had a second interview with Chris.
Great.
She nailed it, of course.
But she doesn't want to totally leave her job.
So they struck up a deal.
She works at City Hall part-time, and two days a week, she still gets to be the greatest nurse in the world.
Win-win.
We need to remember what's important in life.
Friends, waffles, and work.
Or waffles, friends, work.
It doesn't matter.
But work is third.
So listen, Crazy Ira, check this out, okay? I'm at this club last night just killing it, the Snakehole Lounge.
Oh, yeah, is that a gay club? Hello? Shut up, ass.
Come on, man.
So I'm dancing on the floor with this super-hot chick.
Me so horny.
More like a dude, I bet.
Hello? Did you wet your whistle? - I wish.
- Me likey.
No, no, no, no.
She spent the whole night talking to her friend, arguing about their feelings.
That's me! Who knows? She's probably a lesbian.
They were in the bathroom a long time.
Hey, Leslie.
Hey.
Thank you for that year-over-year maintenance cost analysis.
That was really helpful.
You're so welcome.
I was thinking about you when I wrote it.
'Cause I was, um 'Cause I told you I wanted to read it? Yeah.
That's a good reason.
Anyway, Chris wants to see us in his office.
I guess we should head over there.
All right.
All right.
All right, cool.
Great.
See you there.
I'll see you there, Benjamin.
Ben.
All right, "Lesliemin.
" Leslie.
Hi, Ben.
Oh, hey, Ann.
Wow! That was the most sexual tension I have ever seen in a conversation about documents.
It can't happen.
We could both get fired.
That's a dumb rule.
I know! Well, if you have to follow it, I would just suggest avoiding one-on-one, tension-y situations with him.
You're right.
Good plan.
I am sending you two on a trip.
Really? Really? The Indiana Little League Baseball Tournament is upon us, and Pawnee hasn't hosted it in 20 years.
So, I would like you two to go to Indianapolis and state our case, because you two are my dynamic duo.
Right here.
Ah Ah And go team! Yep.
Ann, everything you have is too sexy.
This is actually the dress that Julia Roberts wore as a prostitute in Pretty Woman.
I know.
I look really good in it.
I need, like, a sweat suit or something.
I need to send out a signal that nothing is gonna happen.
Oh, this is insane.
It's so obvious you're dying to be together.
And now you're going on a road trip? I mean, you guys could literally "get a room.
" Yeah, and I could literally get "a-fired.
" All right, I will help you anti-seduce him.
Just tell me what else you need.
I need to think of unsexy, boring conversation topics we can talk about in the car.
I have a few ideas.
We could discuss The New Yorker article "The History of the Ladder.
" Okay.
We could talk about different dorms at Johns Hopkins University, and I could read from my Sonicare booklet.
Oh, I have a good idea! What? Why don't you ask him about his penis? Pawnee Zoo, monkey speaking.
Okay! Everyone stop what you're doing and come with me.
All four of you.
Where are you going? Leslie's not here today.
No boss.
We can do whatever we want.
I'm your boss.
That's a good one, Ron.
Let's go.
Seriously.
Come on.
Here's the sitch.
I developed a dope new game show where I ask couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other one answered.
I call this Know Ya Boo.
Oh, that sounds like The Newlywed Game.
Shut up, Jerry! It's not The Newlywed Game, okay? It is totally The Newlywed Game.
But big deal.
Everyone steals.
My favorite movie is Love Don't Cost a Thing, with Nick Cannon, which is based on Can't Buy Me Love, which is based on Kramer vs.
Kramer or something, which I think was Shakespeare.
Don't know, don't care.
And what exactly do you plan on doing with this game show idea? Are you going to shove it up your butt? No.
I'm gonna test it out on you four bing-bongs and work out the kinks, then hire actual attractive people, and make a demo.
What network is gonna buy a game show from you? There's a million networks out there, and they all need programming.
Spike, G4, GSN, Fuse, WOW, Boom, Zip, Kablam, Slurp, Slurp Latin, Slurp HD.
I love Slurp HD.
Have you guys seen Ultimate Battle Smoothie? That's a dope show.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, so, basically every dorm allows bed lofting, but the students have really taken to it at Wolman and McCoy.
Did you go to Johns Hopkins? No.
Do you wanna play some music? Sure! Ann and I burned an awesome CD for the trip.
Jimmy Carter's "Crisis of Confidence" speech, Learning to Speak Mandarin, 16 minutes of Old Timey Car Horn, and something called Banjo Boogie Bonanza.
It's an amazing instrument, the banjo.
Yeah.
I didn't realize it could be this loud.
Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Hi.
My class is here on a field trip, and I'm supposed to interview someone for a school project.
Okay.
You can wait at that table, and someone will be here sometime.
But aren't you here now? No.
It's time to know your I don't have the instrumental backing track yet, but it's gonna say "boo" right there.
Hey, everybody! Welcome to Know Ya Boo.
I'm your host, Tom Haverford, and with me as always is my CGI puppy co-host, Bobby the Boo! Hey, everybody! All right, let's get to it.
First question.
Fellas, which rock star would your lady bang if she could bang one rock star? Jerry! I believe I have heard Donna talk about Prince, a lot.
What'd your boo say? Impressive! All right, Andy, which rock star would your lady get with? Um, this is almost too easy.
Me! Let's check in with your boo! Yay! Oh! Sorry.
Who is Jeff Mangum? The guy from Neutral Milk Hotel.
Oh! Oh.
Neutral Milk Hotel.
What is that? That's my favorite band.
I've told you that, like, a thousand times.
I don't remember.
Why wouldn't you pick me? I don't know.
You're not technically a rock star.
Booyah! Somebody don't know their boo! That's the sound bite that's gonna play when a fight breaks out.
Look, little girl, can we postpone this for another day? It's unsettling having you just sit there.
But my report's due tomorrow.
What's it on? Why government matters.
Really? It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teat until they have sore, chapped nipples.
I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine-year-old.
What's your name, ma'am? Lauren Burkiss.
Lauren, my name is Ron Swanson, and I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know about the miserable, screwed-up world of local government.
You have mustard in your mustache.
Don't sass me, Burkiss.
Let's get started.
"Life, liberty, and property.
" That's John Locke.
What is this? Whale sounds.
Okay.
You can change it if you want.
Yeah? What the hell? Oh, no, no, no.
This is such a great song.
Yeah, I snuck an Al Green song in there.
I want them to get together.
Sue me.
Did you see this? According to their rules, we may not have enough hotel rooms within city limits.
I know.
It's a silly rule.
But maybe they'll be reasonable and not care.
Yeah, maybe we could just point out to them there are tons of hotel rooms just outside city limits.
Uh-huh.
Have you been to the Granville Hotel and Spa? Uh-uh.
They have the softest towels.
Oh, I gotta tell you.
I love a nice towel in my life.
Me too.
I know.
I mean, it's the simplest luxury, but it makes all the difference.
Their bath mats are amazing.
It's like stepping on a lamb.
Oh, hold on.
Hey, come here.
You've got an eyelash on your face.
I got it.
Make a wish.
Learning to speak Mandarin.
Unit three.
Get away from me.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I'm allergic to fingers.
Where are you going? Maybe we should just not talk to each other for the rest of the trip, and I'm just gonna concentrate on the presentation.
Okay.
This is my little brother.
Next up.
The delegation from Pawnee, please? And, so, as you can see, Pawnee has 12 beautiful baseball diamonds, and our seats have extra cushioning due to the massive size of our average citizen.
I have to bring up what happened the last time Pawnee hosted this tournament.
No, you don't.
Good evening.
We begin with our first story tonight.
They're cute, they're cuddly, but now they're wreaking havoc at the State Little League Championship.
Pawnee's raccoon infestation.
Have these little bandits stolen our sense of safety? The raccoon problem is under control.
They have their part of the town, and we have ours.
Muncie is larger.
Bloomington is more central.
What's the advantage of doing it in Pawnee? The advantage is that it's a wonderful city.
I mean, look, I've been to and Pawnee is special.
I mean, the people are passionate and kind.
They love their city.
They take pride in their work.
It's a very, very special place.
Hey, it's Tom Haverford back here with Know Ya Boo.
Let's move to the next question.
Where is your favorite place to smush your boo? Donna! Back of my Benz? Let's check in with your boo! He said, "Her Mercedes"! Jerry and Donna on fire.
April? This question is gross.
That's kind of the point.
What's your answer? In our bed, I guess.
Andy? Where's your boo's favorite place to smush? Get over it.
No, you get over it.
You like some other dude's band more than me.
Do you even think Mouse Rat is the greatest band in the world? 'Cause it's starting to not feel that way.
That band is really important to me.
And, honestly, I've asked you to listen to them, like, a million times, and you never have, so 'Cause their music is sad, and depressing, and weird.
And art is supposed to be happy and fun, and everyone knows that.
You know what? Whatever.
Forget it.
Fine, forget it.
Damn! This game's got juice.
This is your lunch.
Now, you should be able to do whatever you want to with this, right? If you wanna eat all of it, great.
If you wanna throw it away in the garbage, that's your prerogative.
But here I come, the government, and I get to take And that, Lauren, is how taxes work.
But that's not fair.
You're learning.
Uh-oh.
Capital gains tax.
Well, Chris says congratulations and that together we're unstoppable.
Wow, cheers, sir! Yup.
You did it.
No, you did it.
No, normally I do it.
This time, you did it.
Well, all right.
You should take the praise.
Can I get a shot of you guys? Yeah.
Sure.
Hey, when this thing's over, do you wanna grab some dinner? Chris recommended a place.
Sure.
Yeah? Hey, we were thinking about going to dinner, photographer.
You want in? You wanna grab some grub? Uh, no, thanks.
They have great burgers.
Well, you don't even know where we're going yet.
I'm sure they have great burgers there, though.
Come on, photographer.
Last chance.
Okay.
Well, then, it's just us then.
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay.
I tried.
And that, Lauren, is how FDR ruined this country.
Lauren, ready to head back? Well, I guess it's time for you to head home.
I've really enjoyed talking with you.
You are, and this is not a joke, much smarter than most of the people who work in this building.
I liked talking with you, too, Mr.
Swanson.
Ron.
Hang on, hang on, I have something for you.
This is a Claymore land mine.
Use that to protect your property.
Thanks, Ron.
You got it.
Tommy Hilfiger iPhone app, finally.
Hey, your stupid Know Your Boo game made me and Andy get in a big fight.
He just sold his guitar, and he's, like, quitting music now.
What do you want me to do about it? Okay, welcome to the super awesome bonus lightning round.
First question.
Andy, who did your boo say makes the best mac and cheese in the universe? The universe? Kraft? April said Best couple ever.
You just won 50 points.
Wait, why? We got it wrong.
Next lightning round thing.
Who is the number one Colts fan in the world? Wait a minute.
You set this whole thing up so I would be un-mad at you.
Well, guess what, ain't gonna work.
You figured out April's trying to trick you.
That's worth 100 points.
Wait.
No.
Goodbye.
You were really great in that presentation today.
Oh, thanks.
I liked the stuff you said about Pawnee.
That was really nice to hear.
You know, Pawnee is a really special town.
I love living there.
And And I look forward to the moments in my day where I Where I get to hang out with the town and talk to the town about stuff.
And the town has really nice blond hair, too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
And I know we can get into trouble, but I can't take this anymore, and I feel like we have to at least talk about it.
I mean, it's not just me, right? No, it's not just you.
Oh, God.
What? Are you Are you all right? Perfect.
I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean? I'm not buying cocaine.
I'm going to the bathroom.
The whiz palace, as I like to call it.
And I'm not calling Ann, so Ann, we have a serious code Ben.
Well, it's not really code if you say his name.
He told me that he liked me, and I'm gonna go make out with him right now.
On his face.
That's awesome! No, no.
Read me the script.
Seriously? Yes! All right.
"Leslie, it's Leslie Knope from the Parks Department "speaking to you through Ann Perkins, friend and beautiful nurse.
" Thank you.
"Do not do anything with Ben.
"Be responsible, no matter how cute his mouth is.
"Your job is on the line!" Shut up, Ann! You wrote that.
No, you Then, Leslie, Leslie, you don't know what you're talking about.
I care about him very much, and I've had two and a half glasses of red wine, and what that means is I'm gonna go make out with him right now, and it's gonna be awesome.
Yay! No, you're supposed to talk me out of this.
No.
Don't.
Stop.
Shut up, Ann, I'm doing it anyway.
Yay! Leslie! When Ben told me that you had won the bid, I was wildly ecstatic, and I had to come up here and celebrate with you.
There is literally nothing in this world that you cannot do.
So, what's the plan now? Should we take a long walk? Mini-golf.
I'll probably Shouldn't we just go back to Pawnee? Yeah.
Nonsense.
There's no reason to drive all the way back home.
I've got a perfectly good condo right here in the city.
Oh, we couldn't put you out like that.
Double nonsense.
I would love to have you stay with me.
Leslie, you can take the guest room, and, Ben, you have to sleep on my couch.
It is literally the comfiest couch you've ever been on.
This is weird.
We're on Chris' couch.
Yep, we are.
And I'm wearing his clothes.
Well Well Sorry, I keep myself very well hydrated, and my bladder is the size of a thimble.
I urinate roughly I think I might go to bed, too, actually.
Oh, yeah? Okay.
Well, look Good job, again, today.
It was You, too.
Really? Yeah.
Well, that was quick and to the point.
Here's a tip.
The key to a healthy urethra, radishes.
Good, I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, now I'm up.
You wanna Boggle? Are you Ron Swanson? I am.
Okay, what exactly did you teach my daughter? You must be Mrs.
Burkiss.
Lauren was supposed to do a paper on why government matters.
This is what she wrote.
"It doesn't.
" Well said.
Is this a joke? No, ma'am.
I legitimately believe that.
I'm a libertarian.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, she is a fourth grader.
And fourth graders aren't supposed to have their heads crammed full of weird ideas.
They're supposed to do cute reports and get gold stars.
I'm very sorry.
I was only And you ate her lunch? And you gave her a land mine? Really? Well, it seemed appropriate at the time.
I How? You know this is my house, right? Yeah, hi.
Do you wanna come in? You okay? No.
Andy is totally mad at me right now, and I don't know how to deal with him.
So I thought I would ask you.
You know, Andy and I broke up so long ago.
I don't think that I'd be the best source to Please.
What happened? He doesn't think I like Mouse Rat.
All I said to him was that this other band was better, but I don't know why he got all mad, because it's like an indisputable fact that they're better.
They're a real band.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Well, Andy just wants you to be proud of him and his music.
So, this isn't really about being right.
It's more about being supportive.
Oh, wow.
I didn't realize you were a marriage counselor, Ann.
Sorry.
My instinct is to be mean to you.
I understand.
O-M-G.
Leslie, I read that same article.
"The History of the Ladder.
" It's utterly fascinating.
Ben, you're gonna love this.
Really? Do you know that the original image of a ladder is in a cave in Valencia, Spain, drawn over 10,000 years ago.
Oh, my God.
How about some music? This is amazing.
What is this? Oh, man, I love this song.
The pit Wait a minute.
You were in the pit We all were in the pit The pit I was in the pit You were in the pit We all were in the pit What is this? Living out my dream.
Playing a show with the greatest band ever.
That's my guitar.
You bought it back from Shoeless Joe? I actually stole it from his office, but whatever.
He's a weirdo.
Maybe April doesn't think that we're the greatest band in the world, but, man, she loves me.
And I love her.
So, you know, who cares.
I got the greatest wife in the world! Stop.
We're married! We're totally gonna do it later! Oh, my God.
Well, actually, I think it's good that Chris showed up, 'cause I wasn't thinking clearly.
I love my job, Ben loves his job, and it's just not worth the risk.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts.
Oh, well, he's not here.
He took off.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
All I'm saying is, keep an open mind for a while.
Listen to your teachers and read all the books you can.
Then when you're 18, you can drink, gamble and become a libertarian.
The drinking age is 21.
I know.
Another stupid government rule.
So you'll write a new paper? Yeah.
Can you autograph this one for me? Sure.
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever in her new part-time job in the Public Health Department at City Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins! Yay! Leslie, this is so nice! I put a poisonous gas in one of these balloons, so if any of them pops, you may die.
No, April, we would all die.
Gases fill the volume of whatever container they're in.
School.
We have activities every hour on your first day.
day waffle explosion.
" "The start-paperwork jamboree.
" And then 12:00 noon sharp is the inaugural "D-Ann-ce Party.
" Welcome to City Hall, cupcake! How many of you are in here? - There's seven.
And you have an office mate.
His name is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch.
I have an office mate? Get these balloons out of here.
Hi, I'm Ann.
Hey.
Hey.
Just to let you know, I gave the senior center project to Donna.
Sounds good.
The meeting's at 2:00? Yes.
Conference room "C".
Okay.
I think at some point, you and I should probably make out with each other.
Yeah, good call.
The best part of any relationship is the beginning.
No problems, no fights.
Just white wine, cuddling, and crazy amounts of History Channel documentaries.
Hey, we should take separate cars to the restaurant tonight.
Chris is deadly serious about this I know.
I just don't wanna talk about it, okay? I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
By the way, I have a meeting with Marlene Griggs-Knope.
Is that any relation? No.
Oh, okay.
Just a coincidence.
We get it all the time.
We laugh about it.
But I've never met her.
She's Filipino.
Okay, bye.
Why don't you just tell Ben she's your mother? Because Ben and I are in this amazing little bubble right now, and there's no room in here for Chris' stupid rules about us not dating or my ball-busting mother.
Leslie, I'm sorry, but I don't think you thought this through.
You know what I should do? I should get my mother a one-way ticket to London, leaving today.
And that way, Ben never has to meet her and I could visit her in London.
Everybody wins.
What if he sees a picture of her on your desk? What if Marlene says, "Hey, have you met my daughter, Leslie? "She works in the Parks Department.
" Stuart, please, could you give us, like, 45 minutes? It's my office, too.
Stuart.
That guy was rude.
I feel that some structural changes could really unlock this department's potential.
Jerry.
Mmm? I believe you are capable of much more.
I'm not.
Nonsense.
Look in the mirror.
Huh? You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero.
I'm making you head of Public Relations, which means you'll be leading the daily briefing sessions.
Excellent idea.
This is my favorite part about having a new city manager.
They always try to shake things up, and their ideas are terrible, and it brings City Hall to a grinding halt.
I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show.
April, you are too valuable to just be Ron's assistant.
So from now on, you are a multitasking executive aide, assisting the entire office.
Is this a nightmare? April, wake up.
Tom, I just wanna say that you are a wonderful employee and a terrific human being.
Meeting adjourned! Tom.
I enjoy you.
You know what else I enjoy? Your entrepreneurial spirit.
I did recently sell my Chronicles of Riddick DVD on eBay for $10.
Used the profits to buy the Blu-ray.
That's terrific.
I have an amazing project for someone of your talents.
You are going to digitize the entire city archives up on the fourth floor.
No! I hate the fourth floor! Last time I was up there, I saw someone buy crystal meth out of a vending machine.
It's a bad place.
You won't be alone.
Andy.
Starting now, you are nobody's shoeshine boy.
Starting now, you are an administrative assistant.
For three weeks.
Then back to shoes.
Chris! I wasn't super paying attention to what you just said that we'll be doing, but I will give Well, as soon as you repeat yourself in a more interesting way.
Hey, Ben.
Hey, what's up? Nothing much.
Since I'm here, I just wanted to let you know that Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom.
What? Why Also, she can be cruel and difficult, and she makes snap judgments about people that she holds on to for a very long time.
And she's kind of a bully.
Okay! Go in there, you're gonna be great.
God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Here.
Sorry! Hello.
I'm Mr.
Ben Wyatt.
Looks like you got some shirt on your coffee.
Yeah.
You know what happened? I spilled it, but you know how it goes.
Fun anecdote.
The county school district needs four new school buses.
I'm being stonewalled by the board, and I'm hoping your office can help us out.
Okay.
Really? That's it? Yeah.
Actually, no.
It It's probably not possible.
Then I'm confused, Ben, because you just told me it was.
Five seconds ago.
I got a second box of donuts, if anybody What the is this? This, Mr.
Director, is your new desk.
Okay.
This desk is the epitome of the Swedish concept of jämställdhet, or "equality.
" Imagine someone needs your attention.
Somebody say my name.
Chris.
Swivel! What is it, Jerry? You told me to say your name.
And you did a great job, superstar.
Someone else say something.
You look like a freak.
Swivel! April, that is not a very good attitude.
I will keep my eye on you from my circular desk where I can see everything.
Tiny swivel.
See how it works? What about my office and its many walls? That becomes a new public waiting room.
And we got rid of that giant pillar that was in front of your door.
I loved that pillar.
It made it really annoying to stand in my doorway.
Well, get over it, because it's gone.
You're gonna be more accessible than ever.
The fourth floor.
Small claims court, divorce filings, state-ordered drug tests.
It's somehow both freezing and humid.
There's a whole room on the fourth floor where they store the knives they've confiscated from people who went to the fourth floor to stab someone.
You from Parks and Rec? Yeah.
I'm here to show you around.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
What's your name? Ethel Beavers.
Follow me.
Okay, this is you.
Oh, wow! Double computers? I get my own office phone.
Hello, Wall Street.
Buy more stocks.
Now.
This phone kind of smells like a butt.
Try not to move things around.
Because technically speaking, this is still a crime scene.
Here's your name tags.
Here.
Ethel, this shirt is from Theory.
Name tags make holes.
I'm not wearing this.
Do what you want.
Bye, Ethel! Damn it.
Remind me next time to ask her where she was when Lincoln got shot.
"Remind Tom Ask Something.
" You got it, boss.
Hey! Somebody made somebody a mix! And I definitely heard your feedback from last time, so I only put five Sarah McLachlan songs on this one.
Cool.
Should we talk about how you claimed your mom was a Filipino woman you'd never met? Should we? I was just trying to delay the inevitable.
If this turns into something real, then we are gonna have to deal with Chris' rule, and parents, and annoying flossing habits, and a lot of un-fun stuff.
But not yet.
I just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while.
I'm sorry.
Everything's good? No, it's not.
I was completely flustered.
I came off like an idiot.
I mean, at one point, for no reason, I just took off my shoes and held them in my hand.
I'm gonna go ask her how it went, and I bet she loved you.
I loved him! He's a total pushover.
Very odd guy, though.
He's like a goofy, spineless jellyfish.
Why do you ask, sweetheart? No reason.
Don't worry about it.
It's totally fine.
No, it's not fine.
What if she starts going around telling people I'm a pushover? No one's gonna believe that.
When I first met you, I thought you were a fascist hard-ass.
What? A cute fascist hard-ass, but still, you give off a very Education Department now officially requesting 10 school buses.
I thought they only wanted four.
Well, now that I'm a pushover, why not ask for 10, or 20, or 100 new school buses and a fleet of school yachts? How about that? Here's what we're gonna do.
You are gonna tell me everything there is to know about your mom.
And I'm gonna have another meeting with her, and we're gonna have it out.
Or we could go to Belize and go scuba diving.
And we could look at the whale sharks.
You're certified, right? Let's get you certified.
April, do you have that usage report that I asked for? Anything for you, Jerry.
Thank you.
Oh, come on.
Why? Excuse me.
There's a sign at Ramsett Park that says "Do not drink the sprinkler water," so I made sun tea with it, and now I have an infection.
Sir? Sir, are Are you listening to me, sir? Sir, I'm talking to you! Sir! Sir, are you aware that there is waste in your water system? Okay, you need to be strong, powerful, decisive.
This is not a meeting.
It's a battle.
Normal meeting rules do not apply.
I'll be my mom and I'm gonna be very harsh with you, and it's only because I like you a lot.
Okay.
Go! Hello.
Wrong.
What? No preambles.
No introductions.
Just walk in and start talking.
I'd like to discuss the new school bus.
I'd like to discuss your rhyming, Dr.
Seuss.
And you should be sitting by now.
What? Just walk in and take a seat.
Um "Um" is the sound in "dumb.
" That's what she says to people.
And now you've crossed your legs like a woman.
God! Okay, should we just start over? No.
No, we need to put a pin in this.
Here is a list of my mother's top starting with Persian rugs, ending with Daniel Craig.
You have 10 minutes to memorize it.
Deliverance, the movie? Mmm-hmm.
Oh, God.
So Jerry is, like, basically my boss now, which I'm never gonna work for him.
Ron's trapped in this weird desk prison, and I now work at this traveling IV station.
This Mort Jansen's office? Nope.
Tell Mort I said "Your move.
" Oh, my God.
I wanna work up here with you guys.
This is awesome.
How many more of those stupid documents do you have to scan? Just this one, and all the ones in those boxes.
I gotta get out of here pronto.
Time to get those old ladies to do my work for me.
How? By shining down on them with the Haverford charm ray.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Ethel Beavers.
What's up, beautiful? Julianne Moore just called.
She wants her hair back.
Nobody named Julien called.
Never mind.
I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
One, can you help me out with this project we're doing? And, two, will you please invite me to your 30th birthday party? What are you doing? I'm making a test call to your phone to make sure it's working so you don't miss any more calls.
You know what? Don't bother.
Maybe I'll just find an open window and plummet to my death.
Okay.
This isn't gonna work.
Okay, you did not just swivel away while I was talking to you.
This spaceship keyboard is driving me crazy.
I'm down to one word a minute, and the word is "perflipisklup" because I can't fly spaceships.
Donna, you know as well as I do these city manager shakeups always peter out.
You just have to wait.
Usually I'm with you.
But this is Chris Traeger, the six million dollar man.
He won't quit.
So you need to swivel your ass down to his office and have a word with him.
Mommy.
Oh! That is so thoughtful of you.
Of course! I just figured, hey, why not put my mother in a good mood? So, it's my understanding that despite what I said in our meeting, you have somehow increased your request for more school buses.
Excuse me, but I'm having coffee with my daughter.
Maybe we could do this another time.
No, we're gonna talk about this now.
Or if you'd prefer, I could put a permanent freeze on the education budget.
It's your call.
Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom.
He seems pretty self-assured.
There's nothing left.
It's over.
Hey, hey, hey, don't say that.
Now, come on.
Get yourself together and go out there and be the woman you always knew you could be.
Thank you so much.
Who was that? I don't know.
I saw her crying, and so I helped.
What did you wanna talk to me about? Look, Chris, I'm very flattered you thought of me for this amazing opportunity, but I don't really know if this gig is in my wheelhouse.
I tend to work best with young, attractive people.
Tom, I have made you a project leader.
This is a big deal! You should keep an open mind.
Let your brain unlock the door to your heart's future.
I made that expression up when I was 14.
Still in use today.
By me.
Gotta jam.
You know what? It's just not possible.
And don't even bother trying to outflank me either, because you will fail.
Where did all this confidence come from all of a sudden? Hey, guys, come on.
Let's relax.
You know, Ms.
Griggs-Knope Marlene.
There's probably a compromise here.
Compromise is usually a sign of weakness.
Yes, it is, according to Andrew Carnegie.
But your demands remind me of a different quote, from the great Bill Watterson.
"You need a lobotomy.
I'll get a saw.
" I love Calvin and Hobbes.
Me, too! I gotta say, this is some of my best work.
This could not have gone better.
They are really hitting it off.
Thank God.
Crisis averted.
Well, I am very glad you came back up here.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah So you have a deal.
Well, let me mull everything over, and then we can reconnect and hash things out.
It might get rough, but that can be fun.
Ben can handle it.
Yep, I can.
Okay, great.
It was a pleasure.
Oh! Mmm-hmm.
What's so great is, she was impressed by you, too.
I mean, you could tell instantly.
The way you guys were connecting was really amazing.
Now, what I'm thinking is that maybe we should go over to her house You two are just the cutest things on four legs! But why so much black? It's like you're going to a funeral.
She's got a point, babe.
So, marry her then.
I wish! Hey, sorry to interrupt the love fest, but can you hand me that folder there, please, Ethel? Oh, great.
Why you gotta be like that, Ethel? Looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the crib.
Stop laughing, Muriel.
Stop it! I gotta say, I'm a genius.
The only thing my mom loves more than music boxes is McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy.
So, I made her a McSteamy-style music box, and I thought maybe you could give it to her.
She would love you for it.
I think maybe that's not such a good idea.
Why? I mean, it's not the best picture of him, but Your mom kind of, um, made a pass at me.
So, Webster's dictionary describes a pork as a No, it's park Park.
I'm sorry.
Geez, okay.
So You know what, can we start over? Let's Let's go from the first thing.
I said, pork, which By the way, they have a great pork sandwich in the cafeteria today.
Ron Swanson.
Chris.
You have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
Now, wait a minute.
I mean that as a compliment.
So, it pains me to say this.
My department has to go back to the way it was.
Give them time.
They'll adjust.
No, they won't.
They're miserable.
Tom only performs when there's someone to impress, so marooning him on Freak Island isn't helping anyone.
And you made April assistant to everyone? You know who April hates? Everyone.
And Jerry can only function if no one's looking.
You shine a light on him, and he shrinks up faster than an Eskimo's scrotum.
Well, that's very perceptive, Ron.
And, very graphic.
I understand your point, but there's no way that I can just roll over on this.
Okay.
You won't ever hear me say this again, so savor this moment.
I may have a compromise.
Look, she was just flirting a little.
I'm sure she's not really interested in me.
Oh, my God.
I can't even have this conversation.
The whole thing is screwed up now.
There's so many ways to destroy a bubble, but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list.
And I'm sorry, I have to say this, were you asking for it in any way? No! How were you dressed? Oh, my God.
I was wearing this.
Here's what we do.
You issue a government-wide memo about sexual harassment, and then you go to Mexico.
Just for a couple of weeks.
Where are you going? Ben! Ben! Wait.
Just Hey Hi, Mom.
Hi again.
Leslie and I are dating.
We haven't told anyone because there's a rule against office relationships.
But it's happening.
I'm sorry we didn't tell you before you touched my knee, and I trust you won't tell anyone now since it could get your daughter fired.
That is hilarious.
That's what we thought, too.
Well Four buses.
Two.
Deal.
I like this one.
Me, too.
You keep your hands off him.
Margaret's pecan squares.
They are like crack.
I brought you one.
How are you so happy working here? I don't know, man.
It's not that bad.
A year ago, I lived in a pit.
Now I got a job, and a kickass wife.
And my band is so good, and are you gonna eat that pecan square? When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
I read that once on a can of lemonade.
But I like to think that it applies to life.
I don't want lemonade.
It's too sweet and it makes my tongue feel gritty.
So maybe it's time for a change.
Starting now, when life gives me lemons, I'm gonna slice them up into wedges and throw them into vodka tonics, which I will then sip in a burlesque nightclub that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs and two of the Pussycat Dolls.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Kind of figured you'd be back in your office by now.
Well, you know how new city managers are.
Seems like everyone else is back to normal.
How long do you have to do this? A week.
Citizen request.
Swivel, swivel, swivel.
Hello.
I can help you in here, sir.
Oh, man, you're really screwing this up.
I'm gone for one day and this entire shoe shine stand falls apart.
Everything I built.
Jump up here.
I'll show you how it's done.
See, your problem is you're thinking too much.
Wow.
You're really good at this.
Yes.
I am.
When I come back here in a few weeks, I don't want all my regular customers to not be here waiting for me because somebody screwed it up.
Huh? Thanks.
No problem.
See you later, kid.
Wow.
What a moron.
I have some very important news about our favorite mini-horse, Li'I Sebastian.
Yay! Li'I Sebastian! He died last night.
No.
But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most.
Eating carrots and urinating freely.
When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at half-mast, I thought, " All right.
"Another bureaucrat ate it.
" But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian.
Half-mast is too high.
Show some damned respect.
Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him.
But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence.
I got it, thank you.
So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.
Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.
Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate.
Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful.
Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song.
Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better.
Easy.
Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000.
We can give him 50 bucks.
Sold.
Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian.
I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.
It's just a list of facts.
What? Okay, mine says, "You have a cute butt.
" That's weird.
Must be a typo.
Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, "You have a cube butt.
" 'Cause your butt's shaped like a cube.
Yeah.
The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's? Cube butt, cube butt.
Cube butt, cube butt.
Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis.
How is that good news? The other option was shoulder cancer.
Really? No.
Look, you exercise a lot.
You're in great shape.
Little things like this happen with men of your age.
Men of my age? How old do you think I am? Forty-two.
I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150.
Okay.
So.
What's the cure? Get a time machine.
Go back to being 20.
Dr.
Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met.
Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral.
What was that tone? What? Oh, nothing.
Question! Who's a genius? Answer, Tom Haverford.
Reason, Jean-Ralphio just started an exclusive, high-end production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub.
Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.
Jean-Ralphio is a clown.
This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not double-coupon night at a strip club.
First off, double-coupon night is an incredible value.
Secondly, this guy just started a business.
He's my friend.
It would really help him out.
Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great.
Okay, Tom, we trust you.
Make us proud.
Make him proud.
Why don't you just Photoshop that out? Oh, hi, Ann Perkins.
Hi.
How are you? I'm dying.
What? Tendonitis.
Oh.
I don't know if you should lead with "I'm dying.
" You're right, you're right.
So.
What's up with you? I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.
Li'I Sebastian died? He was old, and he had a lot of ailments.
Like tendonitis? I don't know.
I don't have his chart in front of me.
Could you get it? What? No There's no chart.
Oh, my God.
Death is inescapable.
Goodbye, Ann Perkins.
Man, whenever I run into that guy, he always just throws me off.
Don't even talk about Chris.
Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us.
And about how much he hurt you.
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna see Ben in our secret meeting place in a few minutes.
How do I look? What are you going for? Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.
Bulls-eye.
So nice to see you so happy about a guy.
Thanks.
I don't know.
When I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect.
I mean, we have to sneak around, but weirdly, it's kind of fun that nobody knows.
Hello, Leslie.
How long have you been sleeping with Ben? What? How long have you been sleeping with Ben? That's disgusting and wrong.
I don't even get Why would I I've never had sex with anyone anywhere.
It's none of your You have the nerve, the audacity Ben is my boss, technically.
And he is terrible, facewise.
And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him? Maybe you are.
Maybe you're trying to throw me off.
Hmm.
Check and mate.
This is an outrage! Who do I call? Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Ron.
Listen, you're just who I was looking for.
Are you Did you forget the Did you Can I get that thing? Can we just, uh Did you bring it? This isn't convincing.
How did you find out? We've worked together for a while now.
I'd like to think I know you pretty well.
Plus, Ben butt-dialed me last night.
Okay, okay.
And this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
Whoa.
Eleanor likes the tongue.
Hey, show me Pelosi again.
Okay, lay down.
Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Unfortunately not.
This is a scandal waiting to happen.
If you get caught, which you clearly will, Chris will fire you.
And I won't be able to stop him.
Come on, help me.
There's a lot riding on this.
This is what Li'I Sebastian's gonna listen to in horsey heaven.
Okay, let me hear your favorite one so far.
You're a champion little horse And you're dead You're the champion of death You're the champion of death Maybe try to do one without the word "dead" so much.
Or "death" or "you're dead.
" See? You're helping me already.
So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron.
And they're not gonna say anything.
Right.
Just no more fooling around at work.
Okay, yeah.
We can't.
Well, I mean, you know, a situation could arise where you do something good, and I congratulate you.
You know, kind of like this.
Yes.
Like, "Oh, congratulations.
" That feels appropriate.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this.
Hey, lovebirds.
What do I do with this? You can just leave it there.
- Okay.
So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy.
For the memorial ribbons? No doubt.
Which one floats your penis? They're all black.
Maybe to the layman, Jerry.
Obsidian, onyx, midnight, lost soul, rolling blackout, sleeping panther, and void by Armani.
Hey, Jerry, does this look black to you, too? What you saw was not what you think it is.
I was just congratulating her because she got some good news.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
We were both kind of up for this thing, this really I won the MacArthur Genius Grant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, so that's what the hug was all about.
Sure.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Hey, you know what? We'll cover your duties here.
You should just take the rest of the day off.
Okay.
Well, thanks.
Thank you.
And thank you for your discretion.
You got it.
Welcome, everyone.
Sebastian may have been li'I, but his impact on this town and the Parks Department was anything but li'I.
I would like to introduce two of his closest friends.
Cue music and lights, and Go Ladybug, go Coconut.
Coconut and Ladybug both in position.
Not only was Coconut a friend, but she was also a lover.
Our deepest sympathy is with you.
Coconut just took a dump on the stage.
We gotta clean that up.
Code red.
Coconut just took a dump onstage.
Hey, Leslie.
The maintenance guy bailed on us.
No one knows where he is.
He had the fuel for the eternal flame.
No way.
That guy left? What a Okay.
Start the video presentation.
I'll deal with it.
All right.
Jerry, I need you to go get some propane.
No, what about my poem? No one wants you to read a poem, okay, Jerry? What everyone wants, what Li'I Sebastian wants, is for you to get propane.
Fine.
I'll do it for Li'I Sebastian.
Now we have a special presentation, courtesy of the folks at Entertainment 7Twenty.
Hope you brought a change of clothes.
'Cause your eyes are about to piss tears.
You nasty.
Who are we? Where are we going in life? What is the meaning of all of this? These are questions Li'I Sebastian never had to answer because he was a horse.
Instead, he just brought us joy and happiness.
And isn't that the point? You gotta join the company.
I'm the bank.
You're the money.
I know, J, but it'd be a big leap.
And I will take that leap with you.
I'm Thelma, you're Louise.
You can't die full of regret.
Why don't you live your life like that cow from the video? He was a horse.
Yeah.
Because he followed his dreams.
There was no obstacle too large.
No mountain too high.
No valley too low.
Li'I Sebastian had a long life, filled with wonder.
Good night, Li'I Sebastian.
Forever.
We'd like to encourage everyone to buy our merchandise.
All the proceeds will go towards Li'I Sebastian's favorite charity, the Afghan Institute of Learning.
Next, we have a special musical tribute by Mr.
Andy Dwyer.
What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind? This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind.
Up in horsey heaven Here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings And once we've all said goodbye You take a running leap and you learn to fly Bye-bye, Li'I Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Bye-bye, Li'I Sebastian You're 5,000 candles in the wind Hey, why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone? Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser.
Okay, well, why couldn't Donna do it? Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.
This is sort of a mess.
No, it's okay, we're What the hell, Leslie? I thought I was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath.
Why is Councilman Howser doing it? Because you are doing something better.
You are lighting the memorial flame, which is the greatest honor of all.
Oh, my God.
Ron, congratulations.
I saved it for you, Ron.
Who caught you guys? A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us.
It's totally fine.
I think if you would know one thing about me, it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches.
I have cried twice in my life.
Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus.
And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.
His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity.
Okay, deep breath.
I think we got through it.
Thank God.
Yeah.
Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right? No, they were out.
So I just got a big thing of lighter fluid.
It's kind of the same thing.
Huh? Oh! We planned that! Wow, wow! We planned that.
Yay! Please, Ron, I am very sorry.
I guess I put too much fuel in the torch.
Oh, I don't know, Jerry.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Ron, are you mad at me? 'Cause without eyebrows, I can't really tell.
Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.
And we burned it off.
This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable.
What, you want to break up? What? No.
I like you.
Well, then You want to tell Chris.
What? No.
I like my job.
Well, then, what do we do? Okay, operation shutdown.
No more secret hand-holding.
No more smooching in Ann's office.
In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all.
Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired.
I know.
But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.
All right.
Well, then, I'm in.
What are you doing? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry.
No, it's force of habit.
So what do I do, Ron? Do I stay here or roll the dice with Jean-Ralphio? You have no interest in government work, and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude.
I'd love for you to stick around, Tommy.
It'll be damn hard to replace you.
But I'll support you either way.
Two of my lovers in one place.
What a coincidence.
Tammy.
Hello, Ron.
Ooh, what happened here? And more importantly, does the carpet match the face? If you're looking for trouble, take it somewhere else.
An hour ago, a giant fireball consumed my entire face.
And it was far preferable to spending another second with you.
Tell that to your pants-tent.
It's just the way I'm standing.
Go back to the library, where you belong.
Hey, Glenn.
Wanna dance? No, I'm okay.
Just one dance? No.
With mommy? You know, tendonitis is usually caused by overuse.
Have you been working out more than usual? I did do 10,000 push-ups last week.
Oh, really.
That might have something to do with it.
You need to relax.
You're in great shape.
For a 44-year-old.
Yeah.
That's how old you are, man.
You're right.
I've been overreacting.
I don't like thinking about death.
Death is the opposite of Being alive? Exactly.
Look at us.
Talking like friends.
Yeah.
What the hell.
Friends.
Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger.
What's the point in doing 10,000 push-ups if you're gonna do them alone? I'd much rather do 5,000 push-ups with a wonderful woman.
Sitting on my back to increase my resistance.
Copy of our new hit single, 5,000 Candles in the Wind, and the new full-length CD, The Awesome Album.
Eighteen bucks each, $40 for the set.
I don't know.
That's a lot of money.
No, it isn't.
Okay.
Honey, you are awesome at this.
Thanks.
April, I need to ask you something, and it's the biggest thing I've ever asked anybody in my entire life.
Honey, we're already married.
No, this is way more important than that.
April Ludgate, would you be my manager? Seriously? Okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Are you Leslie Knope? Yes.
My name is William Barnes.
Do you have a minute to talk? Sure.
We really enjoyed the service.
That fireball was truly amazing.
I'm glad.
'Cause it was planned.
And you were also responsible for the Harvest Festival, correct? Well, a lot of people contributed to that.
You don't have to be modest.
We know it was you.
You did an amazing job.
Thank you.
We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
And we think that you might fit the bill.
Oh.
Wow.
Which office in particular? Well, there are a couple city council seats we think are vulnerable.
And the mayor's term is up next year.
All we need to know right now is are you theoretically interested in running for office? Absotootly, I am.
Very sorry that I just used that word.
But yes.
I just I've dreamed about this moment for a long time.
Guess I'll be heading home.
Catching the number 12 bus to Satan's butthole? Actually, I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville station.
Red alert, Swanson.
Your ex-wife is back.
No kidding, Donna.
Not her.
The other ex-wife.
Tammy One.
She's in your office.
Would I have to quit my job? Well, that's a long way off.
Of course.
But listen.
When you run, even in a local election, your life becomes an open book.
So if you so much as stiff a waiter on his tip or use a government stamp for personal mail, it will come out.
So before we go any further, I need you to tell me, is there a scandal out there? Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life? Nope.
All right.
Well, we'll be in touch.
Yeah, I think we can do that for a million.
Okay, we'll talk soon.
There was no one on the other end of that phone call, but soon there will be.
Welcome to the Dreamatorium, A.
K.
A.
the headquarters of Entertainment 7Twenty.
We got a pool table, a ping-pong table, a couch with a ceiling on it, in-house DJ.
DJ Blunt.
And best of all, former NBA superstar Detlef Schrempf is on retainer.
What's up, Detlef? So, Tom, what does this business do, again? It's a multimedia entertainment production conglomerate.
I don't know, man.
You have a lot of overhead here.
Ever thought about scaling back a bit and focusing on building your client base? Thanks a lot, Forbes magazine.
But we didn't hire you to give us business advice.
We hired you to look pretty and shoot baskets.
So why don't you head over there and do your thing? We want people to see you when they come in, Detlef.
Big D, hit me! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Come on.
We're living the dream.
Excuse me.
- Are you Leslie Knope? - Yes.
We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
Are you theoretically interested in running for office? Abso-toot-ly I am.
Very sorry that I just used that word.
Before we go any further, I need you to tell me is there a scandal out there? Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life? Nope.
Who were the suits? They want me to run for office.
Oh, my God! Leslie, yea! I know, right? Yea.
- Yea! - Yea! - Yea! - Yea! Wait, what does that mean about you and Ben? I don't know.
I think it's gonna be really bad.
Uh-oh.
You just wanna go back to saying "yea"? Yes, please.
- Okay, yea.
- Yea.
Yea.
- Knope, follow me.
- Just one second.
- Now! - Ron, hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron! What's going on? My ex-wife Tammy is back.
Yeah, I saw her in the courtyard.
No, my other ex-wife Tammy.
Tammy one.
I have accrued 228 personal days.
Starting right now, I'm using all of them.
While I'm gone, you're in charge.
Ah! Also, I keep a sizable supply of ground chuck in my desk.
Remove it or it will begin to smell.
Godspeed.
- Hi, Ron.
- Move! Whoa! Ah, geez.
Warning! High levels of swagger coming through.
Tommy Haverford back in the Parks Department.
Entertainment720 hockey jersey, anybody? Branded mouse pad? Entertainment720 is just a little multi-national that I started with my boy Jean-Ralphio.
What exactly do we do? Let's just say it's too hard to explain.
Donna, you look amazing.
How are the kids? - I don't have kids.
- Wow.
- How long has it been? - Three weeks.
So did you get a chance to look at my sample position papers? How do you feel about my stance on Egyptian debt relief? Uh, well, it probably won't come up in a local City Council election.
But your thoroughness, as always, is impressive.
Thank you.
Now, we have three months.
I think we should start talking strategy.
My strategy is to win.
I've been dreaming about running for public office my whole life.
While other girls were playing with Barbies, I was playing with a Geraldine Ferraro action figure that I made myself from a picture of her that I glued onto a popsicle stick.
See you next week? Okay, I'm looking forward to it.
Hey! What-- - Who was that? - Uh Lady--just ladies.
Meeting for the ladies' yacht club.
- Anchors away, ladies.
- What? Just don't-- Ladies' yacht club? I cannot believe you haven't told him yet.
After I tell him, I'm running for office, we're gonna have to break up.
Why can't you just keep sneaking around? Ann, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated, newborn baby.
What? Before, if people found out, we would maybe lose our jobs.
Now, if people find out, it's gonna be a major scandal.
My campaign will be over before it begins.
- What are you gonna do? - I have a plan.
And it's really good.
I'm gonna postpone telling him until you figure out what I'm supposed to do.
So get crackin'.
How is this on me? Fine! I'll do it.
God, who keeps emailing me? - A penis.
- What? Oh, my God.
Oh-- It's emailing me too.
Whoever this is sent it to every woman in the entire government.
Oh, my God.
He's gonna be so embarrassed.
I mean, that's a crazy accident.
No, Andy, he did it on purpose.
You know what? Respect.
That's a baller move.
Pun intended.
Excuse me.
Chris, Jerry's making us look at dirty pictures on his computer.
It is exactly because of that lewd photo that I am here.
Ben and I are launching a full investigation.
And I want to apologize to all the women And Jerry.
If I could go back in time, and cut your eyeballs out, I would.
- Wow, that is so sweet.
- Thank you.
We are getting a lot of media requests about this.
So Leslie, can you do Perd Hapley? Ho! She can do Perd Hapley.
Hi-oh! Seriously, can you do his TV show? Oh, yeah.
Andrew my man-drew, what are you up to? I'm about to do an experiment where I huck this at the wall and see what happens.
But that can wait.
Shoe shine? Andy, I'm gonna be honest.
I came here today to talk to you.
Now look, you're enthusiastic.
You're hard-working.
You can lift heavy things.
I think there might be a place for you over at Entertainment720.
Oh, my God.
What is that? It's my company! I don't know, Tom.
I mean, I'm just now getting really good at shoe shining.
And I mean, I'm still pretty bad at it.
Let me ask you this.
Are you living your dreams? - I don't know, Tom.
- Well, I'm living mine.
And if you wanna live yours, here's my card.
- It's impossible to read.
- Black print, black background.
It's the coolest possible color scheme.
- Yeah.
- It's also a strong magnet.
So don't put it in your wallet.
It will erase your credit cards, guaranteed.
Destroy my credit cards.
Debt and everything? Mr.
Mayor, I promise you that we will find the owner of that weiner and we will punish him.
Good-bye.
- Ann Perkins! - Hey.
I didn't know who to come to with this, but that picture, uh--there's something very disturbing about the testicles.
I've always felt the same way myself.
The testicles are like the ears of the genital system.
They serve a very important function, but they're not that great to look at.
Okay, wow.
No, I was speaking medically.
They're enlarged.
I think that maybe that guy is sick with something-- perhaps, a hernia, or mumps.
Ann Perkins! You really know your testes.
Thank you? For a female perspective on this scandal, we turn to a woman, Leslie Knope.
I'm about to ask you a question right now and that question is this.
The lewd photo-- just how big a deal is it? Well, frankly, Perd, it's not that big a deal.
If you know what I mean.
I don't know what you mean.
But it had the cadence of a joke.
When men in government behave this way, they betray the public's trust.
Maybe it's time for more women to be in charge.
There you have it, where "it" is the thing Leslie Knope just said about this situation.
Perd Hap-- How was that? Was that okay? Amazing.
That sound bite is gold.
You're gonna get great feedback on this, and we think we can capitalize.
You're gonna announce your candidacy on Friday.
Friday.
In three months.
No, this Friday.
Is that okay? No, yeah.
Yes, it is great.
Okay, we'll do that then now soon.
And, um, I just have something I've been postponing for a while that I need to do, but I'll do it now.
- Great.
- Great.
Yea.
I know it.
- Ben? - Uh, okay.
Ben? I need to talk to you.
That was my brother.
He just had a baby girl.
Oh, my God, that's horrible.
Or good--full disclosure.
I didn't listen to what you just said.
I need to talk to you about something-- Okay, well, before you say anything, let me just show you what I got at Doug's Donuts.
It's an L-shaped eclair! The "L" is for Leslie For your name.
Hey.
- How are you? - Bad, really bad.
Oh, God.
How did the breakup go? Well, I started crying because he gave me an eclair.
And then we made out and spent the night together.
But this morning in the cold light of day, I cooked breakfast and we made out some more.
Wow, you opposite-of-broke-up with him.
He gave me an eclair, Ann! Joe, I've determined that the lewd picture was sent by you because you sent it from your personal email address, stinkmaster69@alumni.
sarahlawrencecollege.
edu.
Really? Sarah Lawrence? Yeah.
I wanted a small college experience.
You also bragged about it to many of your co-workers.
There's an old sewage department saying.
"If you've got a nice drainpipe, there's no reason to hide it.
" I doubt that's a saying.
We are terminating you effective immediately.
Is this because you're jealous? No.
It's because you broke the law.
The law of having an amazing package.
Before we have him forcibly removed, you should know this, that one of our female employees, a nurse, examined the photo you sent her-- I bet she did.
And you have the mumps.
You might wanna get that checked.
Sweet.
Someone's got mumps on his lumps.
Up high.
Anyone? Ron isn't here.
His ex-wife Tammy came, and he got scared and ran away.
Well, as acting manager of the Parks Department, I declare that everything you are saying is stupid.
I love you.
Hey, so Tom offered me a job again.
As my manager, what do you think I should do? Well, what do you wanna do? I think it'd be kinda cool to work for Tom.
So take it.
But working at a start-up can be kind of risky.
So don't take it.
But Tom told me to follow my dreams.
So take it.
- But this isn't my dream.
- So don't take it.
- I don't know what to do.
- Me neither.
You give such good advice.
Babe, I love you.
You're welcome.
Ann Perkins! Hey.
Did you maybe tell people that I diagnosed that guy with mumps based on his porn photo? I did! I was so proud of you.
Okay, because now I have everyone in City Hall sending me pictures of their junk, asking me if they have mumps.
Oh, my God.
Your inbox is literally filled with penises.
- Mm-hmm.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, look.
Ed Miller from payroll.
Before I do this, is there any possible way that we could still keep dating? We've attacked this from all angles.
Either you don't run for office-- Which is out of the question.
Or you break up with him and avoid a potential scandal.
- Do you need to get that? - No, it's just penises.
Leslie, I don't want you to break up with him either.
- There's just no other way.
- Yeah.
Just be direct and honest.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hmm.
It's the entire Sanitation Department for Muncie.
Ooh.
Would you like any wine to start? Yes, and I'm gonna be direct and honest with you.
I would like a glass of red wine and I'll take the cheapest one you have because I can't tell the difference.
- I'll have the same.
- Great.
- Okay.
Here's the deal.
- Okay.
- I really, really like you.
- I like you too.
And I think I know what you're gonna say.
- I highly doubt that.
- I think I do.
- Oh, I don't.
- And, um - I got you something.
- No.
What is this? - Is this jewelry? - It's not, just open it.
No.
Oh, I need to go to Another place.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom-- the Whiz Palace, as we like to call it here-- and I'm going to be back and I'm not gonna split.
I'm here for you because we need to talk about stuff.
- Okay? - All right.
Wait-- - Ron.
- What are you doing here? Running away from my problems.
Come on in.
- Ok, so here's what's going on.
- I didn't ask.
Friday, I'm supposed to announce that I'm running for City Council, and I haven't told Ben yet.
I know I said that we broke up, but we couldn't.
We're still dating.
But now I have to break up with him for real, but I don't wanna break up with him because he's so cute.
He's so nice.
If you're gonna stay here, there are three rules you need to follow.
One, no talk about Tammy one.
Two, no talk about Ben.
Three, no talk.
I didn't even ask you last night.
What is going on with Tammy one? You just violated rules number one and three.
You lose your coffee privileges.
Oh.
Oh, you choose, Knope-- hunting, fishing, or drinking? I'd really love to shoot a gun right now.
Fishing it is.
And so effective immediately, all male employees must stop sending explicit photos to Ms.
Perkins.
If I may, what if based on empirical evidence, I truly believe there's a grave and immediate medical emergency? Were that the case, could I then show you my dong? No.
- That would be harassment.
- Fair enough.
Now completely different scenario.
Let's say I've been watching a lot of women's golf and I've had some wine-- How about this? I'm gonna get a male doctor to come in and do some screenings.
Perfect.
Just as a backup, I'm sending you some photos.
- That will not be necessary.
- That's me.
Brand-new day, brand-new merch.
I got you guys some awesome Entertainment720 stuff.
Donna, this is for you.
Entertainment720 umbrella.
Entertainment720 fly swatters.
Rubik's cube with my face on it.
Breath mints Fireplace bellows.
Anddrum roll please.
Drum roll sound effect key chain.
Shouldn't you be working at your new company, Tom? I am working, April.
I'm making high-level network contacts.
You think Bethenny Frankel sits behind a desk all day? She makes $100 million a year.
How much you make a year? $101 million.
Well, I, for one, am happy to see Tom.
Thanks, Jerry! Here.
Have an umbrella and some breath strips.
Whoa.
All right, enough chitchat, everyone.
- Please get back to work.
- You're not our boss.
- What'd you just say to me? - Ma'am.
Sodid you get a chance to think about my offer? Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
I wanna do my dreams, but I just don't think my dream is working for a company that puts logos on stuff.
That's not my company does.
Although, maybe we'll start.
Hey, what you think? Donnathat looks great.
I could do without this one.
So running for office.
Now I'm gonna have to find a replacement for you.
- I might not win.
- You'll win.
- I might not run.
- You should.
What's our plan here, Knope? I figure we build a fire, roast the fish we shot, and make s'mores.
I don't have the material for s'mores.
I do.
I always carry emergency s'more rations in my car.
Given your hunting abilities and my chocolate supply, I figure we could stay up here for twothree years.
You know, when I was 12, my brother shot me in the pinky toe with a nail gun.
Granted, it was a hilarious prank, and we all had a good laugh.
That's awful.
But I avoided going to the doctor.
I hate paperwork.
After a few weeks, the toe just kinda fell off.
You only have nine toes? I have the toes I have.
Let's just leave it at that.
The point is the doctor said if I had come in right away, they might've saved the toe.
You can't run away from your problems.
Especially if you only have nine toes.
Sorry.
That was uncalled for.
I'm Ron Swanson.
And you're Leslie [bleep] Knope.
You with me? Well, what is your dream? It's to be the biggest rock star on the planet obviously.
But that could take another Don't get me wrong.
Shoe shining has been a been a pretty wild ride.
But is it possible there's something more out there for me? Andy, there's tons of stuff you can do.
I'll help you figure it out.
- Really? - Yes.
One year from now, you, Andy Dwyer, will no longer be a shoe shinist.
Kyle, beat it.
I wanna make out with my wife now.
But you've only done half of one of my shoes.
Here.
Now I haven't done anything.
Scram, kid.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ron! Welcome-- Stop.
First order of business.
I promised Leslie I'd hire her a new assistant so the department doesn't completely shut down while she runs for office.
- You're running for office? - Yeah, City Council.
- Leslie, that is great.
- Thank you.
Will you pledge right now not to raise taxes? - I think that's premature.
- No pledge, no vote.
The point is she needs an assistant.
- Start asking around-- - Hire Andy.
- Andy can do it.
- Sure, yeah.
Done.
Andy, you are now Leslie's assistant.
Honey.
No-- Leslie, I'm gonna work my ass off for you.
I'll do anything you ask me.
I will prove myself.
You don't even have to pay me.
No, honey, no.
Tomorrow, there will be a 300-page orientation booklet as well as a dozen homemade cookies in the shape of your face.
But today There's something else I have to do.
If any of you need anything at all, too bad.
Deal with your problems yourselves like adults.
I'll be in my office, waiting for Tammy one.
You want me to find her? There's no need.
She'll find me.
She has the tracking ability and body odor of a bloodhound.
Okay, so now you're sure that everything is okay, you know, down there? You're perfectly healthy.
That man has the largest penis I have ever seen.
I actually don't even know if he has mumps.
Forgot to look.
I was distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.
I know I've been acting really weird lately, and, um, I really like you.
What I'm about to say is gonna contradict the idea that I really like you, but that won't change-- So just open the box.
Please stop bringing out the box, okay? - Leslie-- - You're being really nice, and what I'm about to say is gonna make you hate me.
Okay, then I'll just open the box for you.
Wow.
You knew? I figured it out a while ago.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you I knew.
But I just--I wanted this to last as long as possible.
We have to break up.
Why? Why do we have to break up? Well, Leslie, everything you've accomplished, you have earned and you have worked for.
I don't want anyone to think that you got where you are today by sleeping with your boss.
But I really like sleeping with my boss.
YeahYeah.
Okay, look.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Um, it's not you, it's me.
I'm not ready for a commitment.
I just don't like you anymore.
I know it's hard to hear that, but You're boring, and frankly you disgust me.
Echh! How did you figure it out? Leslie, there was a dude in the ladies' yacht club.
Yeah, but I covered that pretty well.
Also, you've been making campaign speeches in your sleep.
Granted, you always do that, but they got really specific and moving.
Did I have a good opening line? It was simple, but I liked it.
Friends, honored guests, Pawneeans.
I am Leslie Knope, and I am running for City Council.
- Hello, Tammy.
- Ronald.
That's enough small talk.
What do you want? You remember what I do for a living, I trust? Yes.
You ruin people's lives.
You're being audited, Ronald.
I don't care.
Then why is your mustache trembling? I'm here as a friend.
Call it nostalgia.
Or perhaps guilt for all the times I tried to smother you in your sleep.
- I don't need your help.
- Wrong.
You do.
But as you're so fond of saying, it's a free country.
Good luck.
I hope you don't go to jail.
Sit up straight.
You're not doing your breast any favors.
Thank you.
Hi.
Your breasts are amazing.
Ok guys, a Battle Royale is coming up.
Every department, in one room, arguing for more money.
Budgetary Thunder Dome.
So uhm, make a list of why other departments suck and I gonna get the secret weapon.
Our secret weapon in this budgetary battle Ron.
Every time another department asks for more money, he just stares them down until they back off and/or wet themselves.
Hey, who's ready to get-- what are you doing? Tammy One showed up.
I'm being audited by the IRS.
No! Your worst nightmare.
You know what? Screw this.
First of all, income tax is illegal.
Second, Tammy is a psychological mastermind.
This is just another way for her to put her hand up my keister and control me like a puppet.
I'd rather be locked up.
Ron, this is a federal tax audit.
You could go to jail.
Jail, Ron.
Ron, jail.
Jail, Ron, jail.
You could go to jail.
Jail, jail, jail.
Are you broken? Andy, April! What's up, boss? Stop yelling and being annoying.
Grab your calculators.
Settle in.
Operation "Rescue Ron" is starting.
Don't worry.
I will think of a better name for it by tomorrow.
Here you go.
Calculator.
[Triumphant music] - Hey - Hey, man.
Ben.
Hey, thanks for texting me to hang out.
I've really felt like we've developed a cool friendship, and-- anyway, it was just nice to have that validated.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, we got some documents over at Entertainment720 that seem really complicated.
And I thought, maybe you could take a look at them because nerd stuff probably really excites you, because you're a nerd.
No, of course.
Yeah, no, I just-- put on my Star Wars pajamas and sit in my mom's basement and pore over some spreadsheets.
Sounds great.
Yeah.
W-w-what'd you got? Something called "Break even analysis tables.
" Oh, break evens? Those are really fun.
Yeah, sure.
I'll take a look.
Let's hit it.
What you-- right now? Uh--I have work.
And I thought I had a friend.
All right.
It's almost too easy.
I can hear you.
[Laughs] I know you can, Ben.
That's how easy it is.
So we need to find proof of every tax deduction I've taken in the last five years.
Ron, most of these aren't even receipts.
This one says, "I bought supplies.
2007".
You won't find any bank statements either.
I've heavily invested in gold which I've buried in several different locations around Pawnee.
Or have I? What's this? Some kind of lame drug deal? That is a gentleman's agreement.
I made that man a dining room table in exchange for 60 feet of copper pipe and a half pig.
Well, looks like we have some actual receipts here.
Same amount, every month.
What's this? Every 30 days, I buy shotgun shells and cigarettes and send them home to my mom.
[Laughs] That's so sweet.
Your mom sounds kick-ass.
My first ex-wife's name is Tammy.
My second ex-wife's name is Tammy.
My mom's name is Tamara.
She goes by Tammy.
You can prevent adult-onset diabetes by getting an annual check-up, exercising, praying Okay.
[Clears throat] Who is that guy? That is Walt Morphling.
He was the director of public health, but he had to retire at 46 because he had diabetes.
That is sad, but also, in this town, understandable.
I would like to shoot a new PSA and I think it'd be good to get someone who's healthy and telegenic, and I thought that you would be perfect.
Ann Perkins.
I am flattered.
And I will do it.
Is there a script yet? Uh, no, because you just approved the idea, like, three seconds ago.
I would like you to write me a script and get it to me in an hour.
And we should start thinking about wardrobe.
Casual? Formal? Semi-formal? Sporty? Scary? Posh? Baby? Those are the spice girls.
I just got caught up in my own thoughts.
I'm very excited about this.
In terms of shirts, I can wear white Welcome to paradise, my man.
You can chill over there by the bar.
We also got basketball at any time you want.
There's Roy Hibbert and Detlef Schrempf.
Oh, my God.
That's an actual NBA player.
He plays for the Pacers.
NBA's on strike, so we got him for only, like, What up, Roy? Is this all you want me to do? Play one on one with Detlef? Yes.
And keep your mouth shut.
Jean-Ralphio! Take me there.
[Shouting] Bump! [Laughs] Who are you? - Uh-- - This is Ben.
He's here to help us with the paperwork.
Ben? Is that your real name? Yes.
Oh, you could do better than that.
I'ma help you out right now.
Your name is Angelo.
Angelo, thank you so much for coming out.
Get a thicker tie.
It looks weird on you.
Makes your head look like a fish.
Secondly, I don't know where the paperwork is, but when you find it, can you take care of it for us? We don't have any pens 'cause we're afraid it's gonna leak in our shirts.
Lastly, I hate the name, Angelo.
I'ma switch it up for you, right now.
Your new nickname is Jell-o shot.
- What do you think of that, J-shot? Do you have questions? Yeah.
Where are we? All right, Ben.
If you need anything, one of these models that we pay to hang around here will grab it for you.
In the meantime, we' gonna be playing video games, tweeting our high scores.
Hit it! Um, hi.
Are you the receptionist? I guess.
I don't really know.
If you don't mind me asking, how much are they paying you? $100,000 a year.
With full medical.
I mean, I would guess they'll be bankrupt by the end of This sentence.
No, thank you.
Is this true? You only spent $40 on clothes in the past 5 years? It sounds about right.
How did you meet Tammy One? Technically, I've known her since I was born.
She was a candy striper at the hospital.
She helped deliver me.
All: Oh, my God.
I grew up in a very small town.
Everybody knew everybody else.
We first took up together when I was 15.
- Awesome.
- Oh, my God.
It was a little scandalous, but everyone feared her, so they kept their mouths shut.
I don't even know her, but she's my hero.
No, she's no hero, April.
She's a hellacious nightmare.
She did, however, teach me everything I know.
Sunday school, sex.
She was my math teacher in middle school and my babysitter, and she taught driver's ed.
I-- Hello.
I don't believe we've met.
I am Leslie Knope, deputy-- I don't think it will be necessary for you to speak again while I'm here.
Why do I only date brunettes? You know, sometimes you eat chicken and you get food poisoning and then, even the sight of chicken makes you sick? Tammy One is my blonde chicken.
Good God, Ronald.
This is a much bigger mess than I imagined.
You'll take a week off from work.
We'll do a complete overhaul of your finances.
I'll need access to all your accounts, and your home.
Is that necessary? Oh, oh.
We're playing a game where everyone says something stupid? [Laughs] You.
What is your name? Tim.
Tim Buckenowski.
Really? No.
Andy Dwyer.
Andy You're going to collect all of this, and you're going to put it in my car.
- What-- - Ms.
Knope.
Yes? You're going to go to payroll and get copies of Ronald's workplace expense reports.
Oh, I--I'm just wondering how long that's going to take, because Ron and I have a very important meeting together.
It's called the Battle Royale.
It's super fun.
Well You and Ron have a big meeting, huh? I'm sure Ron will remember the meeting fondly while he makes toilet wine in a federal prison in Terre Haute.
I'll--I'll head down to payroll.
[Clears throat] Now.
You're not getting any younger.
Yes, ma'am.
She's the cold, distant mother I never had.
I love her.
[Whistling] Good morning, everyone.
Good morning, sir.
How can I help you? Ron? Your moustache fell off.
[Laughs] Leslie, you goofball.
[Laughs] Tammy pointed out that my face looked better without any hair on it.
And it did collect a lot of food crumbs, which is very unsanitary.
Hey, Jer.
Hump day, am I right, buddy? [Snaps fingers] What? What is going on? Where's Tammy One? She moved in with me.
She's really helping me out.
Yesterday, she converted my bank account into a joint bank account with her.
Oh.
That's great.
And how is that gonna help? Not sure.
When she explains it, it makes total sense.
It is so nice having her around.
Here's something neat.
Tammy's got me taking baby aspirin to lower my risk of heart disease.
Science is a miracle.
Any-who, back to the old grindstone.
These emails aren't gonna send themselves.
[Laughs] Diabetes can't be cured.
But it can be prevented.
Make a choice.
Make a change.
And together, we can make a difference.
What do you think? Any notes? Great.
Just as good, if not exactly the same as the last one.
In that last one, I left a nanosecond of a pause between the words, "together" and "we.
" It felt much better.
But I'd love to try another one.
I really think we've got it.
Ann.
This is important to me because it's important to you.
I mean, you spent a lot of time and energy on writing this.
Not really.
So, it needs to be perfect.
So, let's do 1 more, then 5 more, then 20 in a row.
Hey, look who it is.
Hey, hey.
Tom.
Jean-Ralphio.
Professional basketball players.
'Sup, Jell-o shot.
Can I ask you guys a question? How exactly are you making money? Wanna know how we make money? Do you wanna know how we make money? By literally printing out our money.
We bought a printing press.
This prints bills with our faces and the e720 logo on them.
And promote the company by going to clubs and tossing the bills in the air and screaming, "Free money!" You can't just print your own money.
This has to stop, right now.
[Rap music] Aww! What's the deal, baby? One second, you hit the party switch, and the next second, you're all business? I need to see all of your books.
You got it, baby.
Baby! Get him the books.
Aww, Snapple.
Are we calling everybody "baby" now? 'Cause honestly, I love that.
Are we saying "Snapple" anytime we think something's dope? 'Cause I love that, baby.
Do you know what I love? [Whistles] Jell-o shot! [Rap music plays] Uh-oh! Hibbert, Hibbert.
All: Hup, Jell-o shot! Jell-o shot! Jell-o shot! Jell-o shot! Thank you.
We're here to serve you, friend.
I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
Ron, what is this memo you sent to me? You're not going to the battle royale? I have decided not to attend this year.
Okay, first of all, it's disturbing that you wrote a memo, at all.
But you love arguing against government spending.
Why do you not wanna do it now? Leslie, please.
The government knows what it's doing.
I'm confident that I'll-- Ouchie.
You and I are going to lunch.
We have to talk.
Let me just call Tammy first and get permission.
Oh, come on.
Tammy, I was wondering if I could go to lunch with Leslie? Terrific.
Bye.
She says I can't go.
You're going to lunch with me.
I say you can go.
Oh, gosh.
I'm really in a pickle now.
Oh, my God.
When Ron falls for Tammy Two, he turns into a demonic sex maniac.
But this? Neutered wimp? This is worse.
Operation "Golden Dove" is in trouble.
Ron, there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them.
Just blurt them right out, Leslie.
Anything you say will stay between you and me.
Right, my love? Stop fidgeting.
Sorry.
I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
He wants me here.
He invited me.
Na-na-na-na-na.
Don't worry, Leslie.
Tammy's totally cool.
Huh, okay.
Then I'll say it to her.
You're evil, and you need to go.
[Both chuckle] Leslie, you are a panic.
Tammy, may I use the restroom? Remember to wash your hands.
Okay, you know what? Let's cut the crap.
Is this audit even real? In a sense, yes.
But in another, truer sense, no, it is not.
I want Ronald back, but I had to learn about his finances, to make sure my future was protected.
I'm impressed.
He's acquired quite a bit of gold.
You gold digger.
You're literally a gold digger.
The thing I love about Tammy is she calls me on my crap.
Every guy needs that.
Okay, if you want this company to survive, you immediately need to downsize.
I mean, you don't need this airplane hangar um, I think we do.
And two, you have to keep detailed financial records.
Thank you! I've been trying to tell them that! Waste of time.
They wouldn't know a non-employee tax-reportable expenditure request if it bit them in the ass.
Hey guys, which two people here started their own company? 'Cause I'm pretty sure it wasn't you two bozos.
Hey! Look, you guys can swagger around all you want, but businesses need revenue, okay? Unless you start working on an actual plan, you're dead in a month.
That's a fact.
Ben, thanks for your time.
But with all due respect, as far as business decisions go, I think we know what we're doing.
Don't forget to grab a free iPad on your way out.
He didn't even have one.
Diabetes! Fight it! Not quite, but I like the energy--are we still rolling? Yup.
Diabetes! Okay, let's-- can we take a break? I think that's a great idea.
I think we almost have it, and I am very excited at that prospect.
I'll cancel my four o'clock and my five o'clock and my six o'clock appointments.
I cannot believe I dated him.
For a long time.
And he broke up with me! Fat equals splat! As in, "you're dead!" Is there something there? No--no.
That--that sucked.
But there's something there.
I'm feeling it-- let's go right away! It's magic time! From the top, everybody.
There's no one else here.
Basically, we're being attacked by Godzilla.
And to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra.
No offense.
None taken.
I'm very flattered.
Who's this? Who's this tall drink of water? Andy.
Hey, Andy.
How's it hanging? Listen, we need you to break Ron from her spell.
Can't you just move your butt around, or wear a dress made out of meat? Well I could do all those things and have, but that bitch is crazy.
When Ron left her and we got together, she threw acid on my foot.
Eww! Could we take a peek at it? Listen, Tammy One was my Sunday school teacher, too.
She can pinpoint your weaknesses, and then destroy you with just one word.
And a jar of acid.
Oh, my God.
I think I have an idea that could save Ron.
Andy, don't joke around.
I have ideas, too.
You were right to come get me.
My son Ronnie always had a weakness for those ladies.
Oh, wow.
Is this Ron? Yup.
At the age of five.
He's standing next to the first chair he ever built.
Oh, my God! There's a room full of just guns.
Why do you have so many guns? This is America, isn't it? Yes.
Then I don't have to answer stupid questions while standing on my own property.
Let's go.
[Whistles] Okay.
Well, it's definitely Ron's mom.
Tammy? Tammy.
Ronnie.
What's going on? Welcome to the Battle Royale.
Right here.
Right now.
Operation "Soaring Falcon" is in its final stages.
It's time to settle this.
Ah.
An old-fashioned prairie drink-off.
What's in that jug? It smells like jet fuel.
That's Swanson family mash liquor.
Made from the finest corn ever grown on American soil.
Its only legal use is to strip varnish off of speedboats.
If you win, he's all yours.
And if I win, I bring him back to the farm for good.
Wait, what? That wasn't the deal.
Pour it.
I'm thirsty.
Pour me one, too, then.
Let me in here.
I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us.
Leslie, no, don't drink that.
We use it to burn warts off of the mules! Poison! Ugh! I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
How were we together for five months? Well, you know, it's possible you can just date a guy because of where you are in your life emotionally.
Yeah, I suppose you're right, John.
Ann Perkins, I hate to say this, but I have a stain on my shirt.
Which means that everything we shot so far is unusable, but let's use this as an opportunity to revisit the script.
Delivery guy.
- Hey.
- Diabetes! Had enough? Of this watered-down baby formula? Not even close.
Not meven clarse.
Marvin clods.
Glenn Close.
Leslie, you don't have to do this Shh! Go to bed, Jimmy.
Wrah! I can't feel my face.
My face is numb.
[Hissing] What is that? And together, we can make a difference.
That's it.
I think we got it.
Do you think we got it? Yes! Yeah, we have it.
We had it seven hours ago.
Oh, Ann, I--I know that I can be intense, but I'm only trying to be the best me that I can be.
I want to thank you for this opportunity and your patience, and your intelligence, and your insight.
You really are an amazing human being.
Thank you.
Oh, right-- that's why I dated him.
Hey.
I wanted to apologize.
We brought in five accountants to look at e720 and they all said the same thing you did.
If we don't start making changes, we're gonna lose the company.
Okay.
Well, first thing you need to do: Get rid of four of those accountants.
You don't need five accountants.
Again, good advice.
Here.
You really--you need to stop giving these away like candy.
I bought that one personally.
As a thank-you.
It's an iPad.
Everybody prance, now! prance, prance, prance, prance, prance, prance She's had enough.
Call it off.
That's not how it works.
She's out.
Wait.
I'm subbing in.
April, no--that stuff will melt the shell off a garden snail.
Whatever.
I'm Puerto Rican.
I can handle it.
[Sputters] [Bleep], oh, my God! Okay.
This ends now.
Ah.
Mom, you're going back to the farm.
And you, you're going back to hell.
Fine.
I got what I came for anyway.
I found your underground safe.
I stole half your gold.
That's decoy gold.
You think I'd leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground, where anyone could find it? You don't know me at all.
Yes, I do.
I knew you the minute you were born.
And I intend to be there the minute you die.
Ron, your family's weird.
Literally, there's a-- someone reading a magazine, and someone applying nail Polish.
What's that--what is she doing? She's just playing with an iPad.
Tom told me that chair was $27,000.
That chair that has a roof.
The--there's someone over there in a deep sleep.
She's probably being paid upwards of $100,000 a year.
There's this video of a boat.
Look at that thing.
What is that? What are you supposed to do with that thing? 
Support for Pawnee Community Radio comes from the Wendell G.
and Muriel Fathwright Korbleman Foundation, and Sweetums Cares, a nonprofit group that puts umbrella hats on homeless people when it rains.
Welcome to Thoughts for your thoughts I'm Derry Murbles filling in for David Parker, who took off for eight months to study the migration patterns of our nation's squirrels.
We have not seen him since.
My guest today is author Leslie Knope.
The book: Pawnee: The greatest town in America.
I wrote a book.
The first historical guide to Pawnee.
I wrote it as a reference for myself, but then, my campaign advisor said we should make it a big, wide release.
So we had people contribute, we added pictures, and we removed a lot of my poems and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns, and here it is! Leslie, could one say that a book is nothing more than a painting of words, which are the notes on the tapestry of the greatest film ever sculpted? One could say that.
But should one? Join us next week when David Bianculli will be filling in for Richard Chang-Jefferson, who will be filling in for me.
Leslie, would you like to take us out? Okay.
"Please enjoy a song "from the lesbian Afro-Norwegian Funk duo, Nefertiti's Fjord.
" Oh, wow.
They are terrible.
Oh, yes.
Th-they're quite awful.
But they are lesbians, so-- Usually, I only read nautical novels and my own personal manifestos, but I'm proud to make this exception.
Thank you, Ron.
I expect all of you to buy additional copies.
But I wanted the first one that you owned to be delivered and signed by me.
God, this goes on for, like, seven pages! I started thinking about you as a woman, and as a person, and I got carried away.
Okay, mine just says, "Get well soon.
" Aren't you sick? No.
Something's off.
Leslie, I loved your book.
- I read it cover to cover.
- Wow.
I just gave it to you an hour ago.
I'm a speed reader.
I can read over 3,000 words a minute with total comprehension.
One time, I read all of Siddhartha at a traffic stop.
Pawnee's most notorious businessman in the building.
I brought some Entertainment 720 pillowcases for your pillow.
"Never stop dreaming.
" Tom Haverford.
"I never do.
" Chris Traeger.
Respect.
Game recognize game.
Tom, I have Pawnee Today in an hour.
Was my book selected for Joan's cook club? Joan Callamezzo has a book club? Joan Callamezzo started a book club four years ago.
And now she is the literary tastemaker in the town.
The Time Traveler's Optometrist, by Pawnee's own Penelope Foster.
A heartwarming story about a caveman eye doctor who travels to present-day Cincinnati and can see everything but love.
Unreadable.
Then Joan slaps her sticker on it, best seller, four years in a row.
You told me you could get me that sticker.
- Did you get it? - I'm trying, Leslie.
But Joan got an anonymous tip that there's a factual inaccuracy in your book.
That's impossible.
I checked every detail with the historical society.
Did she say what it was? She won't tell me.
I think she wants one of her big "gotcha" moments.
Well, she's not gonna getch me.
I found no inaccuracies.
Joan Callamezzo claims there is a mistake in my book, which there is not, and so now, she's tryin' to get me on a tiny technicality.
So just in case there is a mistake, which there is not, I need all of you fact-checking every single detail.
Jerry, I need you to hit the road and re-interview everyone who lives out of town.
On it, boss.
The rest of you, call me as soon as you find the mistake that does not exist.
Do you think there's actually a mistake in here? I doubt it.
If there's one thing Leslie's not, it's sloppy.
She's also not brief.
This is gonna take forever.
It's just us, I hope.
I wish.
Hey, guys! Ready to do some fact-checkin'? Here we go.
Helping Leslie.
Okey-doke.
Hi.
Joan Callamezzo.
Oh, yeah.
Hi.
Ben Wyatt.
W-we've met.
I don't think so.
Yeah, I was on your show.
Nope.
I'm tryin' to find the words to describe this girl without bein' disrespectful Getting the book into Joan's book club will really help Leslie.
But it'll also help my company, Entertainment 720.
At the risk of bragging, one of the things I'm best at is riding coattails.
Behind every successful man Is me, smiling and taking partial credit.
Now, about Leslie's book.
Am I gonna be happy? We'll see, won't we? Ooh! Wow, you guys are really cute together.
Ben, I'm cute together with everybody.
Anyone find any mistakes? Yeah, actually.
In here, it says that Pawnee is great.
But in reality, it's terrible.
Let Tom know we haven't found anything.
Hey, I'm thinking about getting a new phone.
Do you guys like your phones? I've never used a phone in my life.
What about you, Ron? Do you like your phone? Here's my goal.
I'm gonna get these two people that I've known for a long time to talk to me for five minutes.
Who am I kidding? One minute.
One minute would be amazing.
So, Leslie.
You're a real native of Pawnee, aren't you? Yes, I was born and raised here, Joan.
And I love the town so much, I literally wrote the book on it.
I have it right here.
And also, in this hand, right here, I have a sticker.
Which, when applied, legally determines the newest selection of Joan's book club.
UhOhWhoa! Where-- over here? Back here? - Where is it now? - Come on, stick it.
Ooh.
Oh, hang on-- Stick the sticker.
Stick the st-- No, no, no.
Not so fast.
We received a tip that you, Leslie "born and raised" Knope, were not born in Pawnee.
What? Gotcha! And because you lied about it, we cannot make this a book club selection.
I was born in Pawnee.
I'd stake my reputation on it.
I have to tell you, this feels like gotcha journalism.
In what way? That way.
You put "gotcha" on my face.
After the break: Where was Leslie Knope actually born? Pawnee! We will pull out the world map and speculate wildly.
Joan gotcha Oh, God.
Not the gotcha dancers.
betcha thought you'd get away witcha butcha got caught, didn't ya? Joan gotcha .
Tnat was despicable! I am horrified at her tactics.
That said, the show was pretty lively.
Joan gotcha! don't it hurtcha? It's very catchy.
Okay, Ben, Tom, you stay here, stay on Joan.
Get that sticker.
Chris, Andy, we're gonna stay on schedule, and we're gonna do some damage control.
All right.
Everybody move! Move, move, move! This entire event is under federal jurisdiction.
Unless he's in trouble, there's only one man for the job.
Bert Macklin, FBI.
You thought I was dead? So did the president's enemies.
Call if you need us.
Okay.
All right, so we don't have to fact-check anymore.
But Leslie wants us to be on ready-alert one just in case something comes up.
Now I can get some real work done.
You know, I think I'm just gonna hang out here with you guys, if that's cool.
It's not.
Great.
I could leave.
I could.
But I'm not going to.
I will get my one minute of small talk, damn it.
And it will be casual, and it will be amicable! Did Leslie leave? We wanted her to sign the gotcha wall.
Joanie.
Come on, now.
What was that? I thought we were gonna get that sticker.
Sorry, Tom.
But I am, first and foremost, a journalist.
Let us take you to lunch.
Okay? We'll talk about the book.
And Whatever else may come up.
Let me go change into something more tantalizing.
All right? So, what? We're taking her to lunch now? Ben, Leslie hired my company to get her that sticker.
You're the one that told me "businesses" need "clients" to get "money.
" I was the first one to tell you that? Don't worry.
This is in the bag.
Joan's a married woman.
She wants what she can't have.
It's a game of cat and mouse.
Thank you all for coming.
Our journey begins on page one, the preface.
Oh, boy.
Yes? I think I speak on behalf of everyone in the entire world when I say We need to know the truth about where you were born.
- Okay.
Well-- - Leslie? Let me handle this.
Does it really matter? I mean, how many of you were actually born in Pawnee? Sure enough.
No matter what you heard, ma'am, the truth is, I was born here.
If you were so born here, then where's your birth certificate? Well, I don't carry my birth certificate around - with me-- - Why? Because you're hiding something? You should go back where you came from.
I am back from where I came from! That sentence was confusing! You might as well be from China! Tell us! - That's ridiculous! - Is it? I'm from here! This crowd getting very hostile, Ms.
Knope.
I'm gonna get you outta here.
- Oh, my God.
- Back off! Okay, okay.
Thank you.
Go, go, go! When I was 18, Val Kilmer saw me at a mall and told me I should model.
That never happened.
So, Joan, how is married life treating you? Your husband still know he's the luckiest man in the world? Santino and I are divorcing.
Oh.
It's actually quite liberating.
I'm a woman with a strong sexual appetite.
I'm like a caged peacock, yearning for the wind on her haunches.
That's a powerful metaphor.
Maybe we can get that book club sticker in order, and we can work on unlockin' that peacock cage.
Things have changed, Tom.
Don't make any promises you can't keep.
I'll have another drink, and so will this adorable hunk of caramel to my right.
Drink up, Tom.
I'm gonna go powder my nose Amongst other things.
If you know what I mean.
Crap.
Is she gonna powder her vagina? - You gotta help me, man.
- Why? Seems to be going the usual amount of gross.
No, this is way different.
She's not married anymore.
She had, like, five bottles of alcohol, she's callin' me "caramel.
" You've gotta throw some cold water on this situation.
Start talkin' about nerd stuff.
You know, nerd culture is mainstream now.
So when you use the word "nerd" derogatorily, means you'the one that's out of the zeitgeist.
Yes, that's perfect.
Just like that.
Be incredibly boring.
Well, I've made a little progress.
I'm up to four seconds with April.
Hey, April.
I was looking to get some new music, and I was wondering if you could recommend anything.
The Internet.
I really like your haircut.
- W-w-where'd you get it? - Prison.
How's your sister doin'? She has the shingles.
Who's your favorite character on Sex and the City? Alf.
And Nine seconds with Ron.
You're stranded on a desert island.
What is the one thing that you bring with you? Silence.
We did a flash poll.
now believe you're lying about where you were born.
Honesty is important to voters.
What? Why? Whatever, I can end this now.
Here's my birth certificate.
Mm-hmm.
Well, this just says "Wamapoke County.
" Yeah.
That's the county Pawnee is in.
Well, no.
This won't do it.
See, you staked your reputation on this.
So you need to go down to the county records office in Eagleton and get the original, long-form certificate.
Oh, God.
Don't make me go to Eagleton.
Eagleton is the land of rich, snobby jerks.
There's a whole chapter about it in my book.
I could write a second book about Eagleton and how stupid it is.
And I'd call it Eagleton: The land of rich, snobby jerks.
Hello and welcome to the Wamapoke County Records Office, here in beautiful Eagleton.
My name is Alexis Pratchett.
Take it down a notch, Alexis.
I need a copy of my birth certificate.
Ooh, I'm sorry.
It takes three to eight weeks to receive a birth certificate.
Really? Hi, I'm Chris.
I was wondering if you might make an exception for me? Oh, I'm sorry.
No.
Wow.
That usually works.
Oh, God.
I hate this stupid town with all its stupid, terrible people.
I need that birth certificate.
Leslie, wait here.
Bert Macklin is on the case.
- Andy-- - No.
Don't worry.
I can do this.
Believe in me! That's broken.
Hold on.
Leslie.
Real quick.
Uh, spell your last name for me.
Let's hear it for the boys Whoo! Wow.
That was as long as it was loud.
Take me home, dumpling.
It's beddy time.
Ah.
Hey, Ben.
You like Star Trek.
Talk about that for a little bit.
They're making a sequel I'm assuming with the same alternate timeline.
But if J.
J.
Abrams and company expect us to believe that it's Spock with the romantic tension with Uhura and not Kirk Well, let's just say, the message boards are goin' nuts.
I wanna take you both home and [bleep] bend you over and just [bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep].
at the same time.
Whoo! I'm leaving.
Wait, wait, wait.
We gotta get her home.
Tom, I know your business is failing, but this just isn't worth it.
It's not about the business anymore, man.
Sh-she's a disaster.
We gotta make sure she gets home safe.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
What the hell? Okay, let's get her on the bed.
- Okay.
One.
- Oh, my God.
Two.
Three.
Let's go, bro.
Say what you will about Joan, but she knows how to decorate a bedroom.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.
Where the hell am I? I just wanna see how soft these sheets are.
One second.
Tom, no.
Come on.
Let's go.
Ah! Joan, we left you some water and aspirin by the bed! Bye! Got it! Got it! Nice! I also got this dude's briefcase.
It was just layin' there.
Kind of a panic move.
I believed in you, buddy.
But you should put that back.
Okay.
Okay, so.
Leslie Barbara Knope, born January 18th, to Robert and Marlene Knope, in Eagleton, Indiana.
I'm from Eagleton! Is it true mom? Was I born in Eagleton? Yes, it's true.
No! Pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons at the time.
So we had to go to the next closest hospital.
I'm sorry.
Did you expect me to give birth to you in an infested, disease-filled room? Mom, why didn't you tell me? You try telling that little girl she's not from Pawnee.
I certainly couldn't.
So you were technically born in Eagleton.
Who cares? I care.
The people of Pawnee care.
I wrote on the cover of my book that I was born in Pawnee.
I went on Pawnee today, and I called Joan a liar! I'm the liar.
I'm worse than a liar.
I'm an Eagletonian.
Morning.
Is Leslie here? Aw, man.
I am so tired.
I took a half-shift at the hospital last night.
And I had this really weird patient.
Weird how? I probably shouldn't talk about it.
It's one of the grossest things I've ever seen.
Talk.
Well, this guy came in.
He got his hand stuck in a Pringles can, and he tried to cut himself out.
- Was there a lot of blood? - What kind of blade did he use? Uh, three-and-a-half-inch? Serrated? Buckets of blood.
He passed out over his arm, and slumped onto the floor.
Did the bone show? Very good question, April.
Answer her.
Yeah.
The bone showed.
Everyone in the universe loves a gross medical story.
Boom! I win! And so when I finally cleaned up the vomit, I found the toe.
I forgot about the toe! So did we! Crazy, right? That story's awesome! Indeed.
Thank you for sharing, Jenny.
Ann was getting a little chummy.
When people get too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them.
That's a genius move.
Thank you.
You're welcome, Lester.
Oh, my God.
I wonder who else was born in Eagleton.
Voldemort, probably.
Bad news, team.
Entertainment 720 was unable to get the sticker for Leslie's book.
The sticker is the least of my problems.
If I come clean about where I'm from, then my political career is over.
You don't have to tell them a damn thing.
The only thing the voters need to know about you is your name.
And even that, I go back and forth on.
I'm sorry, but I disagree.
Leslie, where you were born is a piece of trivia.
Where you're from That's what makes you who you are.
And you are from Pawnee.
You're more Pawnee than anyone I know.
So I say, tell them the truth, and trust that they're gonna respect you for it.
Damn it, he's right.
Well said.
Thanks, Ron.
You're welcome, Steve.
Joan.
Thanks so much for havin' Leslie back on the program.
Well, thank you for getting me home last night.
I wasn't, uh, feeling very well.
Because of some bad seafood that I ate.
Yes, that's probably what it was.
I'd like to apologize to those that I've misled.
I thought I was telling the truth, but, sadly, I was born in Eagleton.
Wha--? Well, that is worse than I ever could have hoped for.
I learned something, Joan.
It's not where you're born.
It's where you're from.
When I was nine years old, I broke my arm.
Sledding on that giant hill behind Kernston's rubber nipple factory.
- You know, "nipple hill".
- Of course.
- It gets very slippery there.
- I know that.
- Especially when it's wet.
- Yes.
And, Jim.
Jim Kabernick.
I know Jim.
Jim and I have gone to school together since we were, like, three years old.
Yes, that's true.
Do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade? Why--why did you bring that up? I said yes.
You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out.
And everybody called you "the gerbil" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips? Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV.
The point is you can't choose where you were born.
But you can choose where you live.
I love this town.
I always have.
I always will.
And that's why I wrote a book about it.
And that's why I'm running for City Council.
Look, I'm not crazy.
I know Pawnee isn't Paris, or London, or Chicago.
But it's a great place to live.
And work.
And serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege.
And, yes, every town claims its diner's waffles are the best in the world, but somewhere, in some town, there really are the best waffles in the world.
So delicious, and rich, and golden brown that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town.
Somewhere, those waffles exist.
Why can't it be here? Joan put us in her book club.
Although I could do without this.
Leslie? Here's the thing.
I've been all over the State.
Indianapolis, Bloomington, Lafayette, Muncie, Gary All the places you mention in the book.
And I interviewed all the people you mentioned.
And so far, there is not one incorrect fact.
So now I'm going to head to the house, say hey to Gayle, wish my daughter a happy belated birthday It was yesterday And then I'm gonna head back out and hit all the towns in the southeast.
But is there anything I should know? Any new info? No.
You're doin' great.
Godspeed.
- Doin' what I can.
- Yep! Hey, Ron.
Gotta go, Donna.
Can't talk.
He just seemed so happy.
I didn't say anything.
Gentlemen.
Wildeness weekend is upon us.
There will be no video games.
There will be no Internet pads.
This weekend you have two parents: Me and Mother Nature.
And I am Mother Nature's brother: Brother nature.
But you can call me Andy.
Or brother nature.
Your call.
- Thank you, Andy.
- Brother nature.
For the last three years I have served as troop leader of the Pawnee Rangers.
This is our handbook.
I wrote the whole thing myself.
Okay, it's time to give out the badges.
Um, let's see.
Emily, you get the badge for most community service.
[Applause] To Casey, the best penguin blog badge.
[Applause] To Abigail, flyest hairstyle.
And Ann gets the badge for second-flyest hairstyle.
Oh! I wasn't competing for that.
I'll say.
Five years ago, a plucky fifth-grader wanted to join the Pawnee Rangers, but their executive council said what obnoxious jerks always say.
"No.
This is males-only.
Go start your own club.
" She couldn't.
So I did.
We're called the Pawnee Goddesses, and we're freakin' awesome.
Hey, Ron, whose club do you think is better, yours or mine? The answer is mine.
Say mine is better.
It's not a competition.
Oh, but it is.
Your club made it a competition when they kept girls out.
[As a Southern belle] Oh, my stars.
I'm just a little lady.
My fragile constitution cannot handle the fearsome outdoors.
I have no problem with strong women, Leslie.
Who's Leslie? My name is Annabelle Vandergraf, and, y'all, I just fall to pieces when the sun shines on my hair--ed.
However, the Pawnee Rangers were founded because some boys want to go out into nature and learn traditional survival skills without being distracted by girls.
Well, my awesome goddesses don't want to be distracted by losers.
Say my club is better, Ron.
Say it.
My club is better.
Say it.
Come on.
Say it's better.
Say it.
Say it's better.
Say my club is better.
Say it.
Give it up.
Whose club is better? Mine.
Say it.
You know it.
Say it.
On principal, I never say anything that another person is obviously trying to get me to say.
My first wedding ceremony took two hours, because after the priest said "Repeat after me" I fell silent.
[Triumphant music] I've been auditing the budget, and I noticed you're way behind on your paperwork.
Uh, Jerry, you haven't filled out a PC-10 form in two and a half years.
Aw, jeez, I'm sorry.
Yeah, we kinda do our paperwork at our own speed.
Oh, really? Well, I kinda need you to do it at my speed.
Fine, I'll do them.
What is wrong with you today? Did they cancel Game of Thrones? Nothing is wrong, just do your job.
And they would never cancel Game of Thrones.
It's a crossover hit.
It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts.
They're telling human stories in a fantasy world.
Fill out the forms, please.
Thank you.
I used to have one really good reason for staying in Pawnee.
But now, I'm not sure what's keeping me here.
Although, I am just two sandwiches away from a free meatball sub.
This is expired.
[Girls squealing] Rangers, as a reward for coming on this trip, I have gotten you each two gifts.
Go ahead.
Open 'em.
What is this? That is a canvas sheet, the most versatile object known to man.
It can be used to make tents, backpacks, shoes, stretchers, sails, tarpaulins, and I suppose, in the most dire of circumstances, it can be a surface on which to make "art.
" What's the second gift? The second gift is the box itself.
You have 10 minutes to assemble a shelter using only your two gifts.
Go.
Ladies! The goddess cabin has never looked better.
This year's cabin refurbishment badge is going to be hotly contested.
Okay, so what did everybody make for their loosely structured craft time? Lauren? I made a "Gertrude Stein.
" [Applause] Amazing.
Lauren, that's so good! I really wouldn't want to follow that.
Ann? Oh, boy.
Um I was making some cornhusk dolls for everyone but they kinda turned out wrong so they look like monsters.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna put that over there.
In the fire.
Well, Ann's keeping us warm.
And that's important.
April? [Strums ukulele] What was your craft? .
I drew something on my arm.
It's a pioneer girl watching her grandmother get trampled by a buffalo.
[All ooh and aww] Yeah.
This right here's all the blood coming out her face.
[Rap music] DJ Bluntz is in the building, here to announce that Tom Haverford is in the building.
Oh! 1-2, 1-2! Donatella.
T-mobile.
Three words for you: Treat.
Yo.
Self.
Both: Treat yourself 2011.
Once a year, Donna and I spend a day treating ourselves.
What do we treat ourselves to? - Clothes.
- Treat yourself.
- Fragrances.
- Treat yourself.
- Massages.
- Treat yourself.
- Mimosas.
- Treat yourself.
- Fine leather goods.
- Treat yourself! It's the best day of the year.
Both: The best day of the year .
I got a question.
Mm-hmm? What do you think about inviting Ben to come along with us today? What? Noo! This is our thing.
But he really seems like he could use a day off.
He's like a skinny little rubber band that's about to snap in half.
Exactly.
He doesn't know how to relax.
Donna, you and I are relaxation professionals.
There's no way Ben can slow down enough to keep up with us.
My Nubian princess, this is our holy day.
It's the one day a year I allow myself to be selfish.
Ooh, cupcakes.
Those are all for me, Jerry.
This homemade bulgogi is so delicious, Kayla.
This is the best Korean food I've ever had.
I would say it's almost as good as lukewarm beans from a can.
Right, Ron? I'm trying to teach my boys about rationing food, and your self-indulgent ethnic food court isn't helping.
Goddesses, let's go over our schedule for this afternoon.
We have hiking, and then capture the flag, and then a puppet show about the Bill of Rights set to "Party in the USA" by Miley Cyrus, and then we have lasso training, and a s'mores-off.
[Cheering] So what's on our schedule, Mr.
Swanson? We have one activity planned: Not getting killed.
Jerry.
Oh, everybody must be at Rangers weekend.
You know, I actually was a ranger for 12 years-- That's wonderful.
Maybe you should take the day off.
You know, rest is very important.
Did you know that lab rats who are deprived of rest grow tumors all over their bodies? You should Google it.
It's horrifying.
Uh, thank you.
Yes.
You know, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go have lunch with my daughter! You know, Chris, if you wanted, you know, you should join us for lunch.
My daughter, she's really sweet.
I would love to, Jerry, but I'm afraid that I am busy.
I have got to run.
Google those rat tumors! Both: Treat yourself 2011 Oh, lord.
Is he eating soup? On a bench? Alone? Tom.
[Sighs] Fine.
Come on, rubber band.
Come with us.
What? What are you-- No arguing.
And no soup in the Benz.
- Get in.
- Wha? What? What is happening right now? [Girls screaming] [Ukulele] Great pillow fight, girls.
That was one of our best ones yet.
Okay.
Now it's time for awards.
Lulu gets the golden pillow.
And the silver pillow goes to Janie.
[Knock at door] Ooh! Yes, what is it? Ms.
Knope, I don't like the Rangers anymore.
I want to become a Pawnee Goddess.
I did it! My club is officially the best club.
I would give myself a merit badge that says "Best Club Founder," but I don't have one, so I'm going to give myself "Prettiest eyes" as a placeholder.
I secretly always wanted this badge, so it works out great.
You were defecting? I like you, Mr.
Swanson, it's just All we do is sit in silence and eat beans.
Those beans were a reward.
Well, see, the thing is this club is for girls only.
Maybe you should start your own club, for boys.
Get back to your canvas box.
We'll discuss this no further.
And I'll thank you to keep the ruckus down so my boys can focus on solitude.
- I'm sorry, Darren.
- Let's go.
So, treat yourself day is just a day where you go to the spa and then the mall? [Sighs] I knew you wouldn't get it.
Well, I'm a relaxation novice.
Give me some guidance.
Listen to me, Ben-to box, the point of this is to pamper yourself.
Just relaaax, man.
I can't.
Something about the sound of harps that makes me nervous.
Oh, my God! - Hi, Donna.
- Hey.
Relaxation lesson number one: Acupuncture.
It's great for your back, and your rear.
Needles in your face, pleasure in your base.
- [Laughing] I know.
- That's my boss.
[Clears throat] Hey, Chris.
Uh, I would like you to meet my daughter, Millicent.
Wow.
Jerry, great job.
I'm your dad's boss.
And his much-younger friend.
Pleasure to meet you.
Isn't she beautiful? I say she looks like my wife, Gayle, and Gayle agrees.
[Laughs] So, anyway, we were gonna go to lunch, so-- I retroactively accept your original offer.
Let's go! Ladies, I just wanted to thank you for not cheering when I sent Darren away.
Ms.
Knope, wasn't Darren just asking for the same equality that you and the goddesses wanted five years ago? In a sense, but it's a little bit more complicated than-- Wasn't your answer the very same thing that the ranger council said to you? "Stick to your own kind"? Who wants homemade peanut brittle? Ms.
Perkins, please, we're in the middle of a debate.
Sorry.
Come on, goddesses.
We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them.
I disagree.
What about a public forum? You always say that there's no better solution for a hot-button issue than a good ol'-fashioned public forum.
[Low] Great idea, Lauren.
What was that? I said, "great idea, Lauren.
" I've taught them too well.
I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters.
I'm so proud.
And a little annoyed.
But mostly proud.
Just relax and don't move.
Okay.
Ah This is the most stressed-out I've ever been in my life.
Ben, listen.
I'm gonna talk to you about things you like to take your mind off the needles, okay? [Grunts] Accounting.
Trigonometry.
Stamps, probably.
More of a rare coins guy.
Help me.
Help me! There is nothing that I like more than running for charity.
You know, last summer I did a 50-mile bike ride - for the red cross.
- Yes, she did.
Millicent Gergich, biking for charity is literally one of my interests on Facebook.
[All laugh] I can't believe how alike we are.
I know, it's like we're literally the same person.
[Laughs] We are having a moment.
Attention, everyone.
Welcome to wonder weekend's first-ever public forum.
Our topic today? Should the amazing goddesses take pity on the once-powerful Pawnee Rangers, and let them into our clearly superior organization? Ron, your opening statement.
This forum, like all public forums, is a waste of time.
Thank you.
Powerful stuff.
Okay.
Let's open up the floor to debate.
Who-- yes, Abigail.
Isn't it like Brown vs.
The Board of Education? Separate but equal is never really equal.
We should let the boys in.
Mmm, interesting.
Casey? I disagree.
I think there's a benefit to educating the genders separately.
I see where you're coming from.
Let's hear from a ranger.
Anyone? Darren? It's cold and dirty out here.
And you guys have candy.
I want the candy.
The goddesses are making some well-informed statements, but the most compelling point is from Darren, about the candy.
We have amazing candy in there.
Welcome to Nirvana, the Plaza at Eagleton.
There's a reflecting pool out back, there's an old-timey train that runs through the mall, and three Burberrys.
If you tell your friend, "hey, meet me at Burberry," they gotta specify which one.
Let's hit it.
I really want this dress, and I like this crystal beetle, but it's expensive and there's no use for it.
Donna Meagle? Treat yourself.
Velvet slippies, cashmere socks, velvet pants, cashmere turtle.
I'm a cashmere-velvet candy cane.
Treat yourself.
I mean, this is insane.
Jerry, a word? Of course.
I had an amazing lunch.
I've already passed the kale salad I had.
But, even better? Your daughter was delightful company.
Now, I don't want to put you in an awkward position, but-- You would like to date my daughter.
Yes! But you are her father.
And that is a sacred thing.
I would like to spend the next 2 to 4 days with you so you can get to know me better, to find out if I'm the kind of person who's good enough for your daughter.
Then, you can come with us on our first 3 to 6 dates-- Chris, I appreciate the gesture, it's very nice, but, Milly, she's a grown woman, and of course I trust her.
And I trust you.
Jerry.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Boys, I'm trying to teach you something about nature and self-reliance.
Nothing beats hard work and determination.
Is this the Pawnee goddesses? I've got the puppies you ordered.
Oh! The puppies for the puppy party that we're having in our cabin? Those puppies? What? Noo! [Laughing and fawning] Man, did you buy anything for yourself today? Yeah, I got this pack of socks.
Plain white socks? That's not a treat! Donna! Get me away from him.
Look.
Maybe this is our version of treat yourself day and he needs to do his version.
What are you talking about? Wyatt, if you could blow big money on one thing-- not sock money-- what would it be? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is a whole new level of nerd.
You're right.
This is ridiculous.
What am I doing? Wait.
No, no, no, no.
I mean that in a good way, Ben.
Listen to me, you're part of the treat yourself team now, okay? If that costume somehow makes you happy, you're gonna buy it.
And you're gonna wear it out of the store, okay? You're gonna treat yourself.
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna treat myself.
Thanks, you guys.
[Crying] Thank you.
I really needed this.
[Sobbing] I'm gonna treat myself.
Uh-oh.
Batman's crying.
I am a goddess.
A glorious female warrior.
All: I am a goddess.
A glorious female warrior.
Queen of all that I survey.
All: Queen of all that I survey.
Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar.
All: Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar.
[Screams] [All scream] Congratulations, you are now goddesses.
Oh, my God! [Applause and cheers] Now, have yourselves a puppy party.
[Puppies barking] Oh, boy.
Hey.
Can I sit down? Look, I didn't mean for this to happen.
I have a lot of respect for the Pawnee Rangers, even if they were jerks five years ago.
You're not a jerk.
You're a good troop leader.
Not for these times I'm not.
It's taken me a while to see this, but these kids I don't understand 'em.
And they certainly don't understand me.
That's not true.
No, it is.
And it's okay.
People change.
Their interests change.
It's the way of the world.
When did kids get so interested in fun? Ah I'm gonna turn in.
You were right, by the way.
Your group is better.
What's wrong? Out with it.
I was seeing a woman, uh, for a while, and then we stopped seeing each other.
Uh, pretty recently.
That's why you've been off your game.
Sorry, dog.
You're a catch, Wyatt.
You're gonna be okay.
There's chickenheads everywhere, Ben.
Chickenheads all around this mall.
You're gonna find one, and you're gonna be great.
But, for now, why don't you let it out? Treat yourself to a good cry.
One question, though.
Yeah? Why so serious? Wait, I got something.
Oh! Cool! Awesome! Nice! Thanks, D-money.
What kind of bait did you use? I bought this mackerel at the supermarket.
I've been standing in the water with the fish on my hook for 30 minutes.
I saw it on an episode I Love Lucy.
Pathetic? Maybe.
But, feels pretty good to have a bunch of little boys be super into me.
That came out wrong.
Ron! Come fish with us! That's okay.
Seems like you have things under control.
Come on! Come do that thing where you catch one with your hands! I've seen him do it, it's incredible.
Ron, come on! We need you to help us have fun! First annual Leslie Knope remote control speedboat race! [Cheering] See ya Monday.
Jerry.
Where did you come from? Listen, as I said earlier, I want keep everything above board in regards to my relationship with your daughter.
And, as you know, Millicent and I went out last night.
And it went terrific.
Chris, that's great, but you really don't have to do this.
Again, the date was amazing, we had sparkling conversation, and, full disclosure, she did spend the night at my house.
Have a great day, Jerry.
What are you doing here? We're here for the club.
That was last week.
The ad says today.
Ad? "Are you tough as nails? " Would you rather sleep on a bed of pine needles "than a mattress? "Do you find video games pointless "and shopping malls stupid? "Do you march to the beat of your own drummer? "Did you make the drum yourself? "If so, you might just have what it takes to be "a Swanson.
"Pawnee's most hardcore outdoor club starts today.
Boys and girls welcome.
" Swansons! Are you prepared for whatever lies ahead? All: Yes, sir.
Before we proceed, do any of have any dietary restrictions? Correct, you do not.
First outing is right now.
I will be teaching you to dig a proper trench.
Does that sound like something you want to do? All: Yes, sir.
This will be no fun at all.
The Town of Pawnee invites you to stay tuned for more Parks & Rec.
And to try our delicious local corn.
[Sighs] The Internet's not working.
Ben! We need your help.
Guys, I've told you how to do it.
You just unplug the router and then you plug it back in again.
Guess I'll do it.
Still not working.
Well, give it a minute.
God.
[Sighs] Okay, it's working.
Hmm.
Eyeballs wrapped, uhm vampire teeth Boom! Vampire teeth.
Good.
Spider webs.
- Done.
- Mm-hm.
Fake blood capsules.
Oh, they didn't have any.
Really? That's gross, I love it.
We are throwing a Halloween party at our house.
It's gonna be the greatest thing ever.
Someone will die.
Of fun! And of murder.
And there's gonna be beer, pumpkins Bloody goblins.
Fake ones.
It's gonna be awesome.
We have decorations Dead people that we just murdered.
Not murdered.
But pictures of dead people from TV or movies.
Mutilated bodies.
B-but fake ones.
Candy, dancing, Tequila.
All kinds of food and snacks.
Blood orphans.
No blood orphans.
II don't know what that is.
I want you on message, and the message is Leslie Knope.
If you're not talking about you, you're talking about the wrong thing.
I hate talking about myself.
Get over it.
I talk about myself constantly.
Everyone loves me for it.
I really am amazing.
When you work in government, people often suspect that you're anti-business.
So I'm throwing a little meet-and-greet with business owners, and I've asked Tom's company to help.
Here's my opening line: "Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, and I'm in the business of being city councilor.
" - Oh, my God.
- I'm not going to use that.
This is your primary target.
President of the chamber of commerce, Martin Kernston.
Oh, yes, from Kernston Rubber Nipples.
"The nipple king.
" Photos, BIOS, likes, dislikes, prescription medications.
I've heard of Martin Kernston.
- I know a little bit about him.
- Oh, really? Well, which of his advisors does he trust more, Ted Flirtman or Rex Spax? Well, it depends, Flirtman is more of a confidant-- I made up both those names.
Okay, I'm on it.
Get at me.
Jean-Ralphio, stop crying.
What? Hold on, slow down.
Hold on-- Allergic to chestnuts.
And good haircuts.
It's too tight, looser.
No, I feel like we need to inflate it more.
No, I told you, I'm a sumo wrestler after he lost the weight.
I take it we're having a party.
Dude! I knew there was sometngng I forgot to tell you.
Sorry.
No, no, no, it's fine.
Why should you guys tell me you're gonna have an enormous party? I-I didn't tell you I was gonna be quietly working in my room.
- That's a good point.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I guess we're even.
If you need me, I'll--I'll definitely be awake.
Because I-I won't be able to sleep.
Because of the party.
You know? So All right.
My family is very non-confrontational.
My parents' method of problem-solving is to kind of keep everything bottled up and just subtly hint at what's bothering them.
And after 36 years, they are still divorced.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tom, this is not what I pictured at all.
This looks like a party for Entertainment 720.
Is Entertainment 720 running for office? It's a small business.
You're trying to show people you have a good relationship with small businesses.
Now the party, that's all about you, Boo.
Okay, then shouldn't my face be on these rugs? I'm sorry, no.
It's always been a dream of mine to be a rug.
And it's finally happened.
Tom, now is not a time for you to explore your weird dreams.
Okay? I want all of this gone, all of it.
Except that cake.
Keep tha tcake here.
Just scrape off the words.
Donna? Blue shirt Badge Nightstick.
You are a policewoman.
Yup.
- You're a regular-- - Sherlock Holmes.
I solved that mystery before you did.
Okay, this was fun.
Andy! You are UFC legend Chuck Liddell.
That's right.
Girl from The Ring.
To me, Sherlock Holmes is literally the greatest character in the Western canon.
Smart, intuitive, handsome.
Replace his pasty British frailty with superhuman physical fitness, and you get Sherlock Traeger.
Mister Potato head.
That's right.
Hey, where's my lovely daughter tonight? She's at home.
I knew that you would be here.
And I was worried that you might be concerned, seeing us together at night.
You're a very thoughtful guy.
But really, I have no problem with the two of you dating.
R-really, I mean, look at you.
You're just, you know, beautiful.
You're beautiful.
On the inside where your spirit lives.
Listen, tell her come to the party and I don't mind at all.
Oh, good, I'll text her.
Okay, you can text without looking at your phone? I think it's rude not to maintain eye contact with people that I'm talking to.
That's from me.
Wow! I--th-that's amazing.
- High five.
- Wow.
Hey, Ron.
Good to see you.
Weren't you a pirate last year? Yes.
This is my Halloween costume.
Andrew, are you aware that your bathroom faucet is leaking? Are you kidding me? I just stuffed a sock in it yesterday.
What else do they want me to do? There's an exposed wire above the bathtub as well.
Oh, yeah, shockwire! I call it that 'cause if you take a shower and you touch the wire.
You die! Yes, that is accurate.
Do you have a toolbox? Yeah.
No home is complete without a proper toolbox.
Here's April and Andy's.
A hammer.
Half of a pretzel.
Baseball card.
Some cartridge that says "Sonic" and "Hedgehog.
" A scissor half.
And a flashlight Filled with jellybeans.
Although I've not worked with you professionally, as a private citizen, I have personally patronized each and every one of your establishments.
Mm, I've never seen you buy a salad at Sue's Salads.
That's 'cause I don't hate myself, Tanya.
I'm sorry.
I know I should be chasing your vote, but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things.
And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, uh, I think it's going pretty well.
When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad.
I'm just especially thankful that you could come, Mr.
President.
- Martin.
- Martin.
You were responsible for the Harvest Festival, right? No.
Yes.
Well It was a team effort.
I barely did anything.
I held them back actually.
They succeeded despite me.
I'm sorry.
I worked very hard on that event.
I'm just.
.
Bureaucrats s aren't used to bragging about themselves.
Tom, come over here and talk about how great I am.
Martin Tom M Veverfor I threw this shindig Tom, tell Martin how hard I worked on the Harvest Festival.
It was incredible.
A lot of people say the Harvest Festival is what launched Entertainment 720.
- No one says that.
- I just said it.
My company, Entertainment 720, has an amazing business opportunity for Kernston's.
Mind if I steal you away for a few seconds? Give you the 'tails? The 'tails? The details.
Most people would probably say "the deets.
" I say "the 'tails.
" Just one example of innovation.
Look, I don't like to throw around the word "butthead" too often.
If you call everybody a butthead, then it kind of loses its impact.
But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Hey! You stole the nipple king.
Thanks a lot, traitor.
I'm sorry, I just needed to ask him about this one thing, but we're all good now.
Wh-what if I just introduce you for your speech? I have a better idea.
Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face? I don't need your "help" anymore.
Hi there.
Is there a project you're working on? I know more than you.
All right.
When April and Andy married, I didn't get them a wedding present.
In my experience, wedding presents are nothing more than kindling on a divorce bonfire.
But I think I found a way I can really help them make a home.
You, beanbag, come with me.
I'm an eggplant.
I don't care.
Come with me.
- Why? - I need small hands.
I'm scared.
Look who decided to join the party, bro! That's awesome! Where's your costume? Honey, he's wearing a costume.
He's going as lame.
That's a pretty good costume actually.
But, uh, I think the Batman costume's way better.
You should go wear that.
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna put on a costume because I'm not really attending this party That's at my house.
Hey, listen, if you're mad about something, - you should just-- - No, I'm not.
I'm not mad.
Really? Listen, I feel like you are mad.
So maybe you should just talk to us about it.
My name's Ben.
I'm mad.
All right, that was great, - Thank you.
Thanks for that.
- Soft, soft lips.
Your fingers are salty.
I'm gonna finish my work-- Oren, no! No.
Stay out.
Pawnee has suffered through a tough economy.
And what has kept our town alive is you, the small businessman.
And I'm not referring to your stature, Gary.
You are a giant in this community.
So many business represented here today.
Food and Stuff, JJ's Diner, Glenmore Discount Cemetery, uh, Tramp Stamp Tattoos, Enormous Kenny's Fried Dough Stand and Mobile Phone Emporium.
Who else? Sue's Salads.
Smooth Operator Bikini Waxes.
Jeff's Savings and Loan And Entertainment 720.
Thank you so much for that amazing intro, Leslie.
Hi, folks.
My name is Tom Haverford, and I'm here to tell you a little bit about Pawnee's premiere entertainment and multimedia conglomerate, Entertainment 720 where dreams come, they come true How about we watch this brief promotional film? What? Entertainment 720 has been a fixture of this community since June.
Tom, listen to me.
Turn that off or give me the remote right now.
Can we let it play please? You're lucky that Martin Kernston is here because you're gonna need another nipple.
There.
I think I got it.
Yep, you got it.
Can you at least tell me what you're doing? I'm a homeowner.
I would like to actually learn something.
Yeah.
I'm tightening the valve stem into the valve shank.
I'm replacing the handle.
And then tightening the set screw, which will hold it in place.
Now Oh, my God! We made it work.
It's a good feeling.
A sense of accomplishment and pride.
Damn it, I just love it so much.
Are you okay? Great.
I'm gonna go around this house and fix everything I can find that needs fixing.
You wanna help? I really do.
Good.
That's next.
I can't reveal my identity because of various corporate enemies, but suffice it to say, I run a fairly popular social networking site.
And let's face it, booking e720 was the smartest decision I ever made.
I hope you liked this story.
I invented Facebook.
Wow.
Okay, um I know that video seemed like the rantings of a lunatic pretending to be Mark zuckerberg-- - That's who that was? - No.
That is impressive.
Uh, we're not gonna waste any more of your time.
Agreed.
Let's get right to it.
Please welcome the e720 mailing list divas! I want all of y'all to write down the name and direct phone line for whoever's in charge of hiring independent contractors for your business! Now come join me and let's all take a dip in the e720 mobile hot tub! It's parked right outside.
Le'go.
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.
Thought you weren't coming to the party.
Well, I'm just having a butterfinger.
Oh, really? Is that okay? No.
You're not part of the party, you can't have the candy.
- Back up.
- All right.
- Back up.
- Okay.
I have one sister.
We steal each other's stuff, hack each other's Twitter accounts, set each other's clothes on fire.
There are no rules.
We need to deal with what's bothering you.
Oh, please, come into my room.
See? You're angry at me and you're not talking about it.
And I'm gonna beat you up until you do, because I'm mature.
What are you-- Stop it.
I grew up with five brothers and we fought.
Using the Dwyer method, which was yelling, wrestling, crying, followed by lots of hugs.
And then more wrestling, but the fun kind, and then crying when the fun kind of wrestling got out of hand.
Um, can you let me go? Not 'til you tell me what's wrong.
Um, Mr.
President.
I just want to apologize for the actions of that little weasel.
Leslie, I'm a frugal man.
I don't like extravagance or showmanship.
That's why I cut my own hair.
And it's what's made me a successful businessman.
So if Entertainment 720 is the kind of business you trust, I'm afraid you and I don't share the same values.
There you are, you little bastard.
Get out of there right now.
Leslie, can you do me a favor and just let me sit here? Tom, get out of your stupid limousine hot tub right now, or we are no longer friends.
I'm not getting out.
Fine, then I'm getting in.
Listen to me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, get away from me.
You know what you are? You're a selfish little punk, okay? Just because you want something doesn't mean that everybody has to bow to-- listen to me! You didn't even let me have my one night.
Look at me! I don't want to see your face.
Look at me.
I don't want to see your face! I've been looking at your face all night.
God! I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you? My company's bankrupt.
Okay? Entertainment 720 is dead.
Oh, man.
Excuse us.
Nice form, son.
Make sure you keep a firm pressure on the cranium.
On the cranium? Listen up! I have to turn off the power for one minute.
We're gonna go dark, people.
Bear with us, okay? We gotta switch off the main fuse hose.
It's just a fuse.
It's just a fusePeople.
Just a fuse.
Well, maybe we should get out of this hot tub.
I'm too sad to get out.
And I'm all pruney.
What happened? I don't know.
I guess I just didn't moisturize enough this morning, and I've been laying around-- With the company, Tom.
We're hemorrhaging cash ever since we opened.
They say you've got to spend money to make money.
Well, I don't know where we went wrong.
We spent all of our money.
Okay.
You know what you need? Some good old-fashioned comfort food.
Where are we gonna get Albacore tuna with crispy onions at this hour? Come on.
Looks like you've got the handle on that torque wrench.
Yeah, well, the flange was a little warped.
So I just goosed it with a triple three bolt smack.
That was nonsense.
I know, but it's so fun to talk like that.
You know what? Keep this.
You earned it.
Thanks, Ron.
I need to get more dip.
Great.
I'm going.
- Come on, walk.
- No.
This is a pacifist protest.
Had enough? You need to let go of me.
Yeah, get it.
That's good.
There we go.
- Let go of me.
- He's got his back.
Come on, fight me.
- No! - Noooo.
Nice! Yeah! Oh, my God, Andy, I am so sorry.
Psych! Blood capsules.
- What? - Yeah! I wanted to shock you into expressing your anger.
And that way-- ! My nose is broken.
Oh, my God.
- I gotta go to the hospital.
- Andy, come on.
- Oh, my God.
- Didn't it feel good? Come here.
Yup! Wow, I thought you guys were doing great.
I remember trying to hire you once.
And you said you were all booked up.
That was a business tactic.
For the first two weeks, we told everyone we were booked solid to make people want us more.
Oh, no, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
Well, hindsight is 20/20.
Kind of seems like regular sight should have caught that one.
Also, your logo, it's the worst logo I've ever seen.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's gibberish.
We made some mistakes.
Tonight was my last chance to land a big client.
And I failed again.
God, it's so embarrassing.
Oh, hey, Tom, you're a smart guy.
And charming.
Occasionally.
You're gonna have a lot more good ideas.
Thanks.
Sorry I screwed up your campaign thing.
I really wanted to do a good job.
I made you this amazing video biography.
Of my life? It's back at the office.
- Well, let's eat and go.
- Okay.
Didn't I ask for whipped cream on this? Ma'am? Ugh, does it hurt? Yeah, you broke my nose, so - I'm sorry.
- But I don't even care.
Just get it all out there, man.
Go.
All right maybe you have to start thinking about how--how your actions affect me.
Like, tell me about stuff happening in the house.
Stop referring to my bedroom as a common space.
Stop using my comforter for your pillow forts.
Just respect me.
Absolutely.
- Really? - Yep.
And in return, I'll only ask for one thing, which is for you to pay for studio recording time for my band to do our new album.
It's gonna be about 5,600 bucks.
Deal? That's not gonna happen.
Here's something for the pain and some ice packs.
- Oh.
- You his friend? Him? Hell, no.
We're brothers.
- Excuse me.
Hey.
- Hi.
We should go.
I'm blocking an ambulance.
Ew, if your nose is all weird after this, I'm totally gonna divorce you.
Whatever, I'm gonna divorce you first for wearing my favorite hoodie.
Is everything cool? - Yeah, it is.
- Let's go.
We just can't use Ben's comforters anymore for our pillow forts.
Ugh, what are we gonna have sex on? The year was 1975.
It was a time of trouble.
Watergate, Vietnam, Peter Gabriel leaves Genesis.
But then, a ray of hope Leslie Barbara Knope was born on January 18, 1975.
And she has been a loyal patron of its businesses ever since.
Tom Haverford is a selfish, unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting, good-hearted, secretly kind and wonderful tiny little person.
He went to Kernston's office and basically begged him to meet with me again.
I think he technically might have bribed him.
But hey, you know, whatever works.
It was Mary pickford who once said, "This thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down.
" Tom won't be down for long.
Her name is Leslie Knope.
And I'm gonna vote for her.
And if Lil' Sebastian were still alive, he'd surely vote for her.
And I reckon you should too.
Did ya like it? It's pretty great, right? Worked really hard on it.
Yeah, I loved it.
I'm gonna watch it every day for the rest of my life.
And when I die, I'm gonna project it on my tombstone.
I had an amazing time at that party.
And in the case of the woman who's stolen my heart, the culprit was Millicent Gergich.
You should look into actual detective work.
I will.
And, Jerry, I've decided to take your daughter home.
And we may be having intercourse.
Please, you've got to stop saying things like that to me.
You've got it, man.
Bye, dad.
Everything okay? I can't find my car keys.
Solve this mystery, genius.
Miss Leslie Knope, I present to you Herb Scaifer.
Again, Andy, you don't need to bow.
As you wish, ma'am.
Okay, Herb, what can I do you for? Well, please prepare yourself.
I have terrible news.
You do? The world is going to end tomorrow at dawn.
Aw nuts.
You sure it's tomorrow? Afraid so.
Right at dawn.
Zorp is going to be here to free you from your flesh.
For a while in the 1970s, our town was run by a freaky cult.
And every few years the remaining members predicted the world's gonna end.
And they have an all-night vigil in the park.
It's super annoying.
Turns out when you think the world's ending, you don't aim so carefully in the port-a-potties.
Why does the cult call themselves "The Reasonableists"? Well, they figure if people criticize them it'll seem like they're attacking something very reasonable.
That's weirdly brilliant.
Look, there's nothing to worry about.
They've said that the world is going to end 15 times.
And the only bad thing that's ever happened on any of those dates is Lance Armstrong dumping Sheryl Crow.
- That was a tragic day.
- Hmm.
Live strong.
In any rate, I think Ben and I should accompany you tonight.
Oh, I don't think we have to do that.
No, no, no, I insist.
These people live on planet nutbrain.
I live on planet nut bran.
Bran and nuts are very helpful for your colon! Well, it looks like we're kind of forced to hang out with each other.
Yeah, listen, I'll--I'll come for a bit, but if it's okay with you, I'm not going to stay.
It's just, you know, still kind of weird, right? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mm-hmm, totally get it.
Definitely get it.
Ben and I don't hang out much these days.
Big deal, lots of people don't hang out.
Jerry and April.
Obama and Madonna, probably.
We're in good company.
Hello! So it looks like we'll each end up with about $5,000 apiece.
Stop.
We get five g's each? That's amazing! You started out with 450,000.
Entertainment720 is dead.
It's up in company heaven.
Along with pets.
com, Blockbuster and askjeeves.
My company is no better than a company where you ask a fake butler to Google things for you.
So what's next, Tommy Davidson? I say we invest our ten large and then I "accidentally" get run over by a city bus and we start our own hip-hop label.
We have this place for one more night, right? We're outtie tomorrow at noon.
What if we took every dime we had left, threw one last party.
Made it the essence of everything we wanted the company to be.
A party For the end of the world.
Shh! You had me at "every dime we have left.
" Because I'm in like Lara Flynn Boyle from The Practice.
Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag! What should we do tonight? I don't know, I just figure we'll just order some pizza.
You watch me play Xbox, and then I could watch you make some prank phone calls? We get hammered? Make out? We do that every night.
That's because repetition is the key to a good marriage.
Let's do something weird.
Come on, it could be the last night on earth.
We could do something off my bucket list.
You have a bucket list? Catch the winning touchdown at the super bowl.
Make the most amazing grilled-cheese sandwich ever.
Win the lottery.
Ride a unicycle.
Invent something.
I'd like to remake the movie Shazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
Go skydiving.
Outrun a hippo.
Fly first class on plane.
And when people are walking by, be like this.
All right, well, this is what we're doing tonight.
- Wait, which one? - This one.
And how much is left in the bank account? and four cents.
Whoa! Still a lot left over.
Okay, you wanted to hold $1,000 cash in your hands, that's super disappointing.
Yes! Now this is what I imagined! Have you ever seen this much cash in your entire life? I just handed it to you.
Nickels! I want nickels.
- A billion nickels! - No, Andy.
Evening, gentlemen.
- Hey, Ron! - Hail Zorp.
It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Congratulations to all of you for reaching the finish line.
The Zorpies are ridiculous.
But, like the founding fathers, I believe in absolute freedom of religion.
Also their ceremonies require the playing of flutes.
I happen to make flutes in my wood shop.
Flutes are $80 apiece.
And recorders are 150.
Hey, they're beautiful.
Would you take a check? - You can cash it tomorrow.
- Sure.
Welcome to E720's end of the world celebration.
The entire party's a VIP area.
There's also a double VIP area.
A triple VIP area.
And the Centurion Club elite VIP area.
Sponsored by Sobe Lifewater.
No one's allowed in there, not even us.
Uh- uh.
We also hired ten huge, scary bouncers with earpieces.
- What up, Keith? - Mmm.
He actually once tossed me out of a club three years ago.
Water under the bridge.
DJ Bluntz is mixing up some new beats.
Ballers and ballerettes, fasten your seatbelts.
The perfect party begins Clink! Now.
Thank God.
No one shows up to a good party on time.
If anybody actually showed up right now, the whole party would have been ruined.
It would have been a disaster.
I don't want to go to that party.
Does the city consider them a threat to public safety? Oh, not at all, Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
So I shouldn't interpret anything from the fact that there are two people from the city manager's office here? Well, nothing except that I had nothing better to do.
Which probably says more about me than them.
Thanks.
- Thanks.
- Headline idea.
"It's the end of the world as they know it, but Pawnee feels fine.
" - It's a little long.
- Okay, "Zorp Shmorp! "Doomsday prediction falls flat "as citizens spend pleasant evening enjoying one of Pawnee's finest parks.
" Somehow longer.
Right, okay let's go with the first one.
Great, um, hey, also He's cute.
Is he single, do you know? Chris? No.
He's actually dating Jerry's daughter.
Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben.
What's his story? - Who? - Ben? I-I don't know.
I--I'm not s-- I'm not sure.
He's, um, a man and he's a worker.
And he is--uh, we've never discussed sex, so It's--we've always just been very businesslike, so Your guess is as good-- nay, better than mine.
The end.
By Leslie Knope.
Okay.
Cool, thanks.
H--happy to help.
What's happening? The world is ending.
Oh boy, I know how this goes.
I know how Shauna operates.
She smiles, and then they fall in love, and then they get married, and then she changes her name to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt.
Or he's going to be really progressive and change his name to Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.
God, I am so annoyed that he would hypothetically do that.
I'm gonna remind you that the reason you're not dating him is because you decided to run for city council.
Oh, so just because I can't go out with him, someone else can? - Oh, boy, okay.
- Wow.
Okay, I'm sure this is nothing.
Okay, well, that was definitely something.
- Oh.
My God.
- I know that move.
They're gonna have sex in five minutes.
I've gotta stop this.
I've got to keep them away from each other for the rest of their lives.
- How are you gonna do that? - Unclear! Oh, yeah, ten bucks! That counts as winning the lottery.
Okay, now is this the most amazing grilled-cheese sandwich ever made? Mmm, it's pretty awesome.
Honey, my bucket list doesn't say "make a pretty awesome grilled-cheese sandwich.
" Gotta go back to the store.
We're gonna get a different kind of cheese.
No, no, no, dude, seriously.
This is the most amazing grilled-cheese sandwich ever made, okay? Okay.
What's next? Hey, there you are.
Wow, you two are still talking? Ben hasn't bored you to death by now.
- Hey.
- So boring.
Actually, we were having a really great talk.
- Keep your pants on.
- What? I mean, keep your pants on, girl! I mean, those are really nice pants.
I really like your pants.
Where'd you get them? Do you want to go buy some more pants? Or, um, walk away from here? I might head over to that end of the world party.
Oh, that's where all the losers are going.
Yeah, what is that? Tom emailed me.
- I could check that out.
- Hurrrrr Well, then you should stay here then.
Because you can't go.
I mean, what if you're not here when Zorp shows up? Boy, would your face be red.
When Zorp shows up, your faces will be melted off and used as fuel.
You want to be here for that.
I think I'll take my chances.
Leslie, thanks as always.
Wow.
What an unbelievably unpleasant person.
Melissa, get in there - with your bad self.
- All right.
- You ready? - I'm ready.
Anything you grab is yours to keep.
Hit it! Yes! The perfect party.
It's an elusive idea.
People have to be completely entertained from the moment they walk in, to the moment they leave.
It's a grand experiment.
And I am a party scientist.
Welcome to my laboratory.
That was Symphony for the Righteous Destruction of Humanity in E minor.
By the late Lou Prozotovich.
Reminder.
These flutes are available for purchase.
You can't take it with you people.
Herb, I just speed-read both of your books.
- Ooh.
- And, full disclosure, I think they're bonkers-filled.
But I did notice that you're interested in reincarnation.
Tell me about that.
Well, it makes sense, doesn't it? From the universe, we emerge.
Into the universe, we return.
And there are infinite forms we can take in infinite universes.
What a lovely thought.
Well, this morning at dawn, you will take a new form.
That of a fleshless, chattering skeleton when Zorp the surveyor arrives and burns your flesh off with his volcano mouth.
That was very strange what you just said.
I don't like it as much as that other thing you said.
Oh.
Hey, hey, where you going? Where you headed off to? Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chess-risk? It's half chess, half risk and takes like 15 hours to play.
Okay, yeah, I think I'm gonna go.
- I--okay.
- All right? - Oh, my God! - What? I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.
Oh.
I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.
It's going to freak you out.
It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Leslie, where are you going? I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.
No spoilers, Ann.
She's been there before.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
What's up, what's up? Are you guys having a good time tonight? I think we've gotta take things to the next level.
Drum line, hit it! - Okay, I'm ready! - Good.
Wait! I'm not ready.
Super scared.
Andy, you said you wanted to be an action star.
This is your chance.
Okay.
Okay, you, Natalie, follow the action.
What do I have to do? Just hold up this butter knife to my throat and pretend like you're holding me hostage.
- What? - Ready! I don't know.
It seems a little crazy.
Just crazy enough to work.
Aah! Ahh! Oh, my face! My face! Is fine, Mikhail Petrov! Forget it, Macklin, you're too late-- - I'm sorry, guys.
- Jerry! I need my cheaters.
I cannot see anyth-- you're doing really good, you're doing really good.
- Really? - Yeah.
Help me, Agent Macklin, help me! He's stolen my jewels, and now he's going to ravish my body and he stinks, he really stinks! Okay, Janet Snakehole belongs to mother Russia now.
Oh, that's what you think! - No.
- I hope you like pain! - What are you doing? - Pow! Say the line.
Looks like this Siberian husky is going to be Russian off to jail.
Hey, know what, can I go? Gayle is making a roast.
Ugh.
We've already been down this street.
Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever? Well, I don't know.
Tom's party sounded kind of fun.
Here we are! We're at the special place! Well, here we are.
What do you think? Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station? No, this is a great gas station.
This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.
Uh-huh.
I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M.
Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman.
Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958.
I know what you're doing, Leslie.
I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.
You--you can't do this.
You know we broke up.
And I kind of feel like we shouldn't Hang out together, just the two of us.
Because every time we do, it just makes it harder.
You know? Okay.
Okay.
I think we've done everything on the list that we can actually do.
What about this? Oh, my God, that would be awesome.
- It's impossible.
- No, it isn't.
We have $1,000 in our bank account, and we're young and irresponsible.
I mean, our car would break down.
There's no way we could even get there.
So I'll steal my dad's car.
Look, this is a stupid idea, but right at this exact second, we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it is.
You are absolutely right.
No thinking, just stupid.
Yes! Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.
So the problem with reincarnation is that you could be reborn as a pretzel.
Or a socket wrench.
Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be? Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually.
What religion am I? Well, I'm a practicing none of your [Bleep] Business.
I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.
Ann Perkins that was beautiful.
Drum lines, personalized gift bags, tigers.
This is the best party I've ever been to.
And I'm not just saying that.
For real, T.
T.
, think about it, man.
It's pretty great.
But it's not perfect.
Tom.
Hey, Lucy, what are you doing here? Jean-Ralphio called me and told me that this was a very special occasion and I should come down.
It's nice to see you.
Yeah, good to see you too.
Want to go dance? Yeah, yeah! Uh, give me a minute.
Okay.
I can't believe you called her for me.
That's really nice of you, man, for real.
Thanks.
No, no, no, thank you.
I mean for everything.
I actually forgot they ever dated.
I was trying to hit that.
Dawn is nigh! Zorp the surveyor approaches, and all earthly debts will be repaid.
Last call for doughnuts.
Can I speak with you about a personal matter? Normally, no.
But given there's only 20 minutes until the end of human existence Also, no.
I lost my mind tonight.
I tried to screw up even the potential of Ben dating someone else.
Did you not hear me when I said no? Oh, we broke up because of me.
But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him.
Well, that's significant.
Problem is, Leslie, the world's not ending tomorrow.
The sun's going to rise right over there.
It'll be a regular Friday, and you'll be in the exact same position you were in before.
I know.
It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.
If it makes you feel any better, Leslie, we'll all be dead in 20 minutes.
That does make me feel better.
Thank you, Herb.
- We did it! - Yay! This car is nice! How long you think it'll take us? Uh, the map says 30 hours but I drive really fast.
- 30 hours? - Mm-hmm.
Oh, crap! I didn't bring any music.
No! I'll tell you what.
You play whatever you want, I'm just going to take a real quick snooze for like 12 hours so I'm fresh.
Thank you guys so much for coming out.
If you're too drunk to drive, please take one of our shuttles home.
Valet service will drop your car off later today.
If you're one of our designated drivers, please take a "thank you" bag.
And enjoy the giant bows I put on your car.
- Hey! - Hey.
- It's great seeing you.
- You too.
Are, uh, you sticking around for a bit, or Nah, I'm heading to Bloomington right now.
- Oh.
- Grad school's fun, but I do miss this town.
- Yeah.
- What's wrong? I don't know.
After this is done, I'm gonna be broke, and I'm not gonna have a job.
Well, if it's any consolation, this was honestly the best party I've ever been to.
Hey, it was pretty great.
I-I was really aiming for something-- I'll see you around.
Whoo.
You saw that.
You saw that too.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep thinks you're cute.
- What? - That's why I took you to Mick Jagger's abandoned gas station.
Because she thinks you're cute, and I was afraid you guys were gonna make out and have babies, and I had no right to do that to you or your future children.
And it wasn't until just now that I realized the romantic part of our relationship is over.
So I'm sorry.
And, uh, why don't you tell Shauna to make herself decent and I'll apologize to her as well.
Oh, well, Shauna's not here.
- Oh.
- See what I did? - I do.
- I'm very sneaky.
Okay, okay, well.
It's so much more beautiful than I could have ever even imagined.
Yeah.
I'm trying to find a way to be annoyed by it, but Coming up empty.
Thank you so much.
I never would have ever done this without you.
Thank you.
Where's all the faces? Like the presidents.
All the scholarly work that I did on these texts? Indicated that the world would end.
Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed as you are, Herb.
Yeah, but I went home and began to reevaluate the texts.
You don't say.
And I realized that I'd made some crucial errors well, math is hard.
Yes, well, the actual end of the world is May 19.
Okay, let's see what we've got.
Um, oh, on the 19th we can't give you the park.
We have a Spring spectacular free ice cream giveaway.
Heh! I misspoke.
Yeah, it's May 20? That is free.
- Ah! - Okay.
End of World, May 20th.
Oh hey, Ben.
Have you seen my complete collection of all Ooh! Here they are.
Wow! So, I've been asked to run this year's Model UN at Pawnee Central High School.
Attendance has been low.
And if I don't make it awesome, they may cancel it.
I wonder if I'm gonna make it awesome.
Or I can be South Korea, you can be Bangladesh.
You can form like a Trans-Asiatic alliance.
Yeah, I like it.
And I see the merits of it.
I just worry if we're both in Asia, - it might limit our scope.
- Mm.
I kinda want to roll up my sleeves and make geopolitical problem-solving my bitch.
Amen, brother.
Let's go back to plan "A.
" I'll be Denmark, you be Peru.
Yes! Oh, I didn't really do Model United Nations in high school, so Oh, wait.
I super-did.
I need a few more volunteers.
Andy, will you be Iceland? The bad guys from Mighty Ducks 2? - Don't think so.
- Okay, how about Japan? The bad guys from Karate Kid 2? Even worse.
How 'bout Germany? They've never been the bad guys.
Why don't you be Finland? - Okay.
- Okay? And I'll be the Moon.
No, you're gonna be South Africa or - Pakistan.
- I'm the Moon, or I quit.
- April.
- Moon or quit, man.
Fine.
You be South Africa, and you can also secretly run the moon.
The Moon accepts your ridiculous proposal.
Ron! You wanna join us? Look! I'll let you be America.
And teach kids that not only is government good but that there should be a World-wide super-government? I'd rather sand down my toenails.
Every three weeks, I have to sand down my toenails.
They're too strong for clippers.
Excuse me.
Are you Leslie Knope? Oh, what am I talking about? - Of course you are.
- Bonjour, Madame Ambassadeur.
Thank you so much for coming and trying to help save our club.
We're so excited to see a true Pawnee Model U.
N.
legend in action.
- Thank you.
- I really wouldn't describe myself as a Model U.
N.
legend.
I'd go with icon.
Or hero.
Look, if you ask me, Enron is down but not out.
Who doesn't like a comeback story? All right, you wanna hear my plan, get at me later.
I gotta meet up with an old friend.
All right, peace, man.
Let's go do this lunch thing.
I just have one more quick interview.
I'm still trying to find your replacement.
That is, unless you want your old job back.
I told you before, Ronseph, I moved on to bigger things.
E720 going under was a blessing.
I'm tearing it up all over town like a boss.
Sounds great, Tommy.
I've offered Tom his job back several times, and each time he's told me he's just too busy being an entrepreneur.
Then two days ago, I saw him spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
The young man has a lot of pride.
This isn't gonna be easy.
Ann Perkins.
- Hey, Chris, how's it going? - Not good.
- Can I talk to you? - Okay.
I'm not sure if you're aware, but I am romantically involved with Jerry Gergich's surprisingly hot daughter - Millicent Gergich.
- Yeah.
You were grinding with her pretty hard at April's Halloween party.
That's correct.
Anyway, we've been on four dates, but now Millicent Gergich hasn't returned my last two phone calls.
I think the relationship may be in trouble, and I don't know why.
Wow.
A four-date-long relationship might not be 100% perfect? I think you should launch a full-scale investigation.
The root of sarcasm is truth, Ann.
I am going to launch a full-scale investigation.
And I sincerely thank you for that suggestion.
Glad I could help in these trying times.
Sarcasm again! You're a delight.
You've all been preparing for months for this year's geopolitical scenario global food crisis.
Security Council, we need you to lead us, or billions of people will starve to death.
But most importantly, have fun.
Due to my campaign, the romantic aspect of our relationship is over.
And I'm totally fine with that.
But Ben and I have so much in common.
I mean, we're amazing friends.
And friendship is better because friends help you move.
They drive you to the airport.
Boyfriends just love you and marry you.
Jerry! I am launching a full-scale investigation into my romantic relationship with your daughter Millicent Gergich, and I thought I could pick your brain.
Aw, jeez, I really shouldn't be involved in someth Quick recap things were going wonderfully.
We clicked on an emotional level.
And then suddenly, I just stopped hearing from her.
Now, you must know her pretty well what gives? Here's what I saw go down.
Donna! Yeah! Get in on this.
You're too accessible.
Every time she calls, you answer.
You gotta dangle the carrot, literally and metaphorically.
- Thank you, Donna! - Thanks, Donna.
SoCourtney.
This says you retired in 1968.
No, no, no.
I was fired because I made a pass at an ethnic woman.
And what have you been doing for the last 43 years? Oh, you know, hitchhiking around.
I went to Mexico.
I met a lot of ethnic girls.
They grow on trees down there.
I was in jail for a spell That about brings it up to date.
Sounds to me like you're ready to get back in the game, Courtney.
We'll be in touch.
Another very strong candidate.
Are you insane? He was a million-year-old racist! He said he liked ethnic girls, Tom.
I'm sorry, Ron, but I created a legacy here, and I need to make sure it's protected.
Let's bring in some more people.
In my four years here, I revolutionized the position of administrator and made this place cool.
I was the first person to abbreviate Parks and Recreation Department.
First it was Parks and Recreation.
Then Parks and Rec.
Then P&R.
Then lengthened it just a little bit to Tommy's place.
Okay, wait a minute.
I think I have it.
What if we dropped interest rates.
- Would that help you? - Maybe.
But what if Brazil and Argentina use their oil deposits as collateral? Oh, that's really good.
Under-exaggerate much, France? Ha ha! Nice! Hey, Leslie, you ready? - Oh! - Ow.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
- Hi, William.
- Hi.
You ready? Yes.
Absolutely.
UmThey want me to do a photo op for the campaign so I can bolster my education credentials.
- Can we just press pause here? - How long is it gonna take? I'm not really sure.
Can you just tread water until I'm ready? Oh, sure, yeah.
I'll just tread water until you're ready.
Thanks, buddy.
Leslie and I aren't dating anymore, but, uh, we're friends.
So it's fun.
It's just fun.
It's fun it's fun It is fun.
Thanks a lot.
Yes! Honey! I just traded Finland's military to Kenya for 50 lions.
That's pretty good, right? - Yeah - Okay.
But also militaries are pretty good at protecting countries.
But so are lions.
And you don't have to pay them.
These kids are idiots.
I've just traded all of Finland's boring stuff for every other country's lions? I definitely have more lions than any other country in the whole world right now.
I have no idea what's going on.
But if that ends up meaning something in this game, I'd say I'm set.
Hey, so Russia and China are about to propose their own plan, so the kids kinda want to get ours out there.
Oh, okay this should probably only take five more minutes.
Let's say 10 or 15 to be safe.
Well, how about me make it a cool 40? I'm sorry.
It's just important.
Well, this is important too.
It's kinda why we came here.
I'm sorry, could you Just step over here? - You're in the shot.
- Oh, of course.
Her life is so awesome.
You're lucky you're friends with her.
Shut up, Bulgaria! I know, well, that's the great thing about treaties, - It doesn't even matter.
- Hey! I'm back.
Or, as they say in Denmark "I'm back.
" Most people speak English.
So are you guys ready to polish off this treaty? Oh, uh actually, I merged our treaty with Russia and China's treaty.
I got cut out of my own treaty? Yeah.
I got sick of treading water, so I swam over to Asia, made a deal.
The nation of Denmark would like to formerly request a summit with the nation of Peru over there by the refreshment table.
Because the nation of Denmark needs a juice box.
I am shocked an appalled by the actions of the honorable delegate from Peru.
Leslie, just look I thought I could handle being friends with you.
But I can't, okay? Now, we agreed the other night that we can't spend time together.
I think that was the right call.
But that was in a romantic way.
We can still spend time together as friends.
It doesn't work that way.
You can't just chop up the aspects of a relationship into discrete parts and select the ones you want like a buffet.
- Why not? - Because it's selfish.
Stop being obtuse.
Look, I understand where he's coming from.
But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends? You know what? That leaves me with only one option.
Just excuse me for a Attention.
This is an urgent world matter.
Due to a recent betrayal, my homeland, the great state of Denmark, has officially decided to declare war on Peru.
Scandinavian brothers, on my signal.
Unleash hell! See, I just don't believe in this whole don't let people know how you feel nonsense.
I love telling people how I feel.
Mostly because I love most people.
And I love telling them that I love them.
You didn't tell that girl you love her, did you? - No.
I'm not crazy.
- What is this urgent meeting with Donna and Jerry? Ann Perkins.
I took your advice.
- My sarcastic advice.
- Precisely.
And we're getting to the bottom of what's going on with me and Jerry's daughter, and I thought you would be a tremendous addition to this think tank.
This is incredibly inappropriate.
- Oh, thank you! - Okay, I'm game.
No.
I'm not kidding.
My name's Gary, and I'm from Gary, Indiana.
Amazing.
People like hearing that.
It's probably one of my stronger anecdotes.
A fact is not an anecdote, Gary.
Here's an anecdote Today I met the most boring man in the world.
His name was Gary.
Hmm.
Now Keith.
Under sex, you wrote "Yes.
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha.
" - Well-played.
- Thank you.
Ah, but all jokes aside.
I'm a boy.
Keith, I had this job for four years.
And I can tell you, you get out of it what you put into it.
What are you hoping to get out of it? In like a month or so.
- What? - OhWhat! What am I hoping to get out of this job? Yeah.
Yeah.
Like one one month of money Would be would be just right.
Let me give you a situation.
You're hosting a town hall meeting for local businesses.
Uh That's so much stuff.
You just, uh kept on going.
That was like one thing.
I didn't even get to the situation yet.
Oh! All right.
Well, thanks, guys.
I think we've all seen enough.
Still not totally sure what I'm applying for.
Butif you ask me, I think it went pretty well.
What we need to focus on is how to destroy Peru, specifically one person who lives there.
Madame Ambassador, are you changing the scenario? We didn't prepare for this.
Global politics can change, and scenarios can arise and suddenly you're just like, "wait, I thought this one thing, "but look over there.
That's a different thing, and it's changing everything," and I'm like, "what?" Hold up.
" Who has tanks for me? I-I'm sorry, but We're gonna keep trying to solve the food crisis.
Food schmood.
This is war.
God, it's time for you to nut up, Switzerland.
Well, well, well, look who is brave enough to show his face in Europe.
Say the word, Leslie.
I'll sick my army of lions on him.
Okay, look, I think, um Things are starting to get a little out of control here.
I agree.
You betrayed me, and you went behind my back, and now you need to pay.
I need to I need to pay.
Do I stutter? Oh.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Oh, you know what? You might wanna borrow this.
Ew, no one wants your dirty underwear, Ben.
It's not dirty underwear.
It's a white flag, and you may as well start waving it right now the only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother! Good lord.
They were duds, Ron.
Really, anything would be better than the people we interviewed today.
I guess you're right, Tom.
I'm not gonna find another you.
You were perfect.
Competent enough to keep the bosses off my back, but selfish enough to slow down all the work.
Tom Haverfords don't grow on trees.
If they did, I'd sell 'em.
Tommy trees.
Would you consider coming back? Sorry, Ron.
No can do.
I'm like a shark.
I don't swim backwards.
See ya later, man.
We've been making great strides with genetically modified crops and would gladly pledge to continue the growth of excuse me, Madame Ambassador.
- Excuse me.
- I'm not finished.
Oh, really? Then why do I have the microphone? I move that the Security Council formally condemn Denmark and stop them from making any more unwarranted acts of aggression.
As long as you quit derailing the conference.
People are dying of hunger in Africa.
Oh, cry me a river.
All in favor of the resolution.
- What?! - Oh, that's interesting.
The resolution passes with flying colors.
Denmark is formally condemned.
Bam! That's no problemo, Peru, because Denmark no longer recognizes the authority of this international gang of thugs.
And history will be unkind to those who stand opposed to justice.
Together, we stand and I ask all of you who is ready to join the Coalition of the Willing? The Moon shall join your coalition.
Yeah! We got the freaking moon.
What are you gonna do without tides, Peru? Okay.
We need to stop dealing in hypotheticals.
Ann, we dated.
What happened to us? Really? Do you wanna get real? Sure.
Sounds like fun.
Sometimes your relentless cheeriness is confusing.
Like that time we went to Eagleton and we got that hotel room with the jacuzzi Ooh, this just got real good! And the jacuzzi broke.
But I did eat food off of your body.
- Oh, come on.
- All right, Chris and Ann! I just wanna go back to work.
So the Coalition of the Willing is Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon.
The big three.
Now, here's what we're gonna do.
Ben is probably shoring up his support in South America.
While he does that, we are gonna make sure Attention! The Security Council has decided to expel Peru and Denmark from the United Nations.
Madame Ambassadeur Pourquoi? 'Cause you guys suck.
Look around.
We thought you were gonna teach us how to solve problems.
You've ruined my favorite club.
Thanks a lot.
Did we win? I think we won! What were we trying to do? I learned so much today.
I just wanted to say that I thought it was really cool how everything fell apart in there.
And also, maybe you should talk to Ben.
No.
He's being a jerk.
Please? When Ben gets upset, he becomes a really bad roommate.
He takes really long sadness baths and makes me late for stuff.
I hate it here.
Can't wait to graduate.
Yeah, but summer's gonna totally kick ass.
So you're saying that I intimidated you? - No.
Not exactly.
- Come on.
Talk more about that tantric workshop y'all went to.
I was so into you, okay, and you basically turned me into a female version of yourself, and then you got bored dating me because you were dating yourself.
Huh I mean, I was jogging.
I hate jogging.
- Jogging's amazing! - Jogging is the worst, Chris.
I mean, I know it keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost? Well, I'm sorry that I added five years to your life.
Now I'm being sarcastic.
Like you.
I'm doing something that you like.
Being with you definitely made me do a lot of soul-searching, and I came out the other side being a much more self-possessed person.
Well, I'm glad.
Good luck with Millicent.
Just back off a little bit.
Let her be herself.
Everything'll be fine.
Thank you.
If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe.
That's That's not true.
Well You have to rearrange them.
- Oh - Delegates! I know that you're angry with each other.
Hopefully, this will be your opportunity to have your very own Camp David.
In high school, my buddy David Fundis would have these campouts in his backyard.
We would just chill out, have a bonfire, talk about whatever was on our mind.
We called it camp David.
How do you know about Camp David? How do you know about camp David? Ooookay.
You guys are being stupid, so why don't you work it out - while Andy and I - Throw these scientist bottles - off the roof? - No.
That's right.
See ya.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
It's bad enough that we can't be together, but the thought of us not being friends is Is just too crappy for me to handle.
I was perhaps a little icier than I needed to be.
I just need you to be in my life.
You're too important to me.
I wish I could say it's possible.
I just I don't know if it is right now.
Well, I propose a treaty that states that we have a fun conversation once a day at work for five minutes.
I'll take it to the Peruvian senate.
Or whatever.
- Please do that.
- I'll try.
I'll see what they say.
What do we do with those kids? We totally ruined their club.
I could tell you what I would like when I was their age.
Ben, how are we gonna get Kathy Ireland to do naked aerobics for them? Okay.
I regret telling you that very much.
Hey.
Oh, hey, Ron.
All right.
I gotta come clean.
I saw you spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
What? Macy's? That wasn't me.
There's a Macy's in town? Where's the Macy's in town? I heard they have an amazing cologne sample guy.
Just take the job, Tommy.
Come on back.
I quit to peruse my dream.
And my dream collapsed.
It's embarrassing, Ron.
I can't go from a CEO back to being an administrator.
Is there anything I can do to make you feel okay about coming back? Everyone, please Help me.
I'm trying to get Tom back.
I'm begging.
This department just doesn't work without you.
What do you say? Ron, this is embarrassing.
Even for you.
I'm not coming back.
Peace out, my dudes.
Excuse me, everyone.
That was great.
So what I'm thinking is I'll come back in a few days, you'll beg me again aah! So if it's okay with you guys, I would like to ask Ron for my job back.
Ron May I have my job back, please? Thank you.
I will see you all Monday.
Looking forward to it.
Ah, France, bienvenue.
My name is Cassidy, - and I'm really annoyed with you.
- Yes.
And you have every right to be, but we're hoping what we're gonna show you right now will make up for that.
- What? - Oh, my God! Pawnee City Council chambers.
The nicest room in City Hall by a factor of like a million.
Go ahead.
Sit down.
Leslie and I feel terrible for war breaking out at your Model U.
N.
Which, for the record, Denmark would have won, but that's neither here nor there.
Thanks to a coordinated effort between the parks department and the city manager's office, three months from now, we are gonna hold a State-wide Model U.
N.
In this room, - and you're gonna run the show.
- What? And we will just be not here.
- Or taking some small countries.
- No, no, no, no.
No.
Fine.
Not here.
- Sound good? - Yes! Those kids are passionate about something.
That's important.
That's all there is, really, is passion.
Passion is what makes for good treaties - Cheese! - Good relationships Good pizza.
Good friends.
Good everything.
Including wars.
* Ladies and Gentlemen, "He was gone but never forgotten.
" "He makes all the ladies want" No, I'm not gonna say that.
"Swagger beats and I get the Who's the" All right, forget it.
Welcome back, Tom Haverford! Tick-tock, it's Tommy time! I'm sorry, I have to object again.
This just seems unfair.
I understand that, Jerry.
But the problem is is that Tom came back and Andy's my assistant, so I kinda need him close to me.
Okay, but I can't even hear anything because of the noise from the copier.
Sorry.
These are really important.
Tom! I would like you to redesign our Parks department logo.
Sounds cool so far.
Rethink our visual brand, take these words, and make something amazing.
So you're saying you want me Yes, essentially I'd like Jerry, I am making you my number-two guy Come on, that's too close.
Let's make him a number-three.
Fair enough.
Jerry, you're number three.
There's only two of us.
He has been in this department a long time.
I think maybe you could learn somethg from him.
Our research shows that our park will draw and I want this to be the most amazing, awe-inspiring, fun-filled park ever conceived.
Now how big is the park, exactly? It is .
000003 square miles.
Recently, the last remaining telephone booths in Pawnee were torn down, and on that patch of concrete, I am creating Pawnee's newest tourist attraction$$$ The smallest park in Indiana.
The title is currently held by Martin Luther King, Jr.
Park in Terryville, but guess what? Terryville sucks old car tires, and so does Martin Luther-- No, he does not suck old car tires.
He was one of the greatest men in history.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get competitive.
Has there been any resistance from the community? No, not at all.
It's so small we don't even need to do an environmental impact report.
It's inexpensive, it benefits the town, it's a total slam dunk.
You two, when you work on a project together, Man, all these classes look amazing.
I can't choose.
They do this thing called a "shopping period," where you can just sample as many classes as you want.
- Really? - Yeah.
Sports and Society.
Physical Science.
A crash course? Yeah, but it's not what you think.
Oh.
I did not graduate college, because I did not "attend" it, but I'm trying to improve myself, so I'm gonna start by taking just one class.
If you're gonna take a college course, Andrew, you should explore a new subject.
- Broaden your horizons.
- Yup.
Horizons are dumb.
Never broaden your horizons.
Yup.
Just take something you're great at and get an easy "A".
No offense, Ron, but April's way sounds way easier.
Guitar for beginners.
I value a good education, so I don't want to see Andy waste his time in college.
Of all my coworkers, he is one of a small number whom I do not actively root against.
Ugh, there I go getting all sappy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, I have about nine things I need to talk to you about.
The first is the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Do you know who's bringing scissors? Because I cannot tell you how many ceremonies get derailed when people don't bring scissors.
- Number two-- - Right.
Um, listen.
I'm actually glad you're here.
Oh, yeah? After this project finishes, I'm gonna focus on other departments and cut down my time with Parks and Rec.
What? Well, look, I mean, we tried hanging out together, we tried working together, and it just Bums me out.
No, no, no.
We're just working out the kinks.
You don't need to decrease your time with me.
In fact, you need to increase your time with me.
You need to spend more time with me.
That make sense? I think it does.
No, Leslie, no, listen to me.
After The Smallest Park wraps up, I am going to ask Chris to take over all Parks and Rec business.
Okay? - Okay.
- All right.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to ascertain the whereabouts of some oversized ceremonial scissors.
I-- Those are my pens and pencils.
No, see, I think that Comic Sans always screams "fun.
" Right? But, man, those "r"s in Helvetica, they're just, you know, like, really popping for me.
I've never been more bored in my entire life.
Who cares about letters? is the Sopranos one, where the "r" is a pistol.
Let's think bigger, people, come on.
What about a top-to-bottom makeover for the entire department? I'm talking new uniforms, new signage, new color scheme.
A whole, new, sexy vibe.
I don't know.
This really isn't what Chris asked us to do.
You know, maybe we should just stick to the assignment.
Cool, Jerry.
I'd take your advice if I wanted to be a dead-eyed government drone with no ambition.
Yes, technically my new job is my old job, but I'm not some boring, Jerry Gergich-type guy.
I'm more of a Steve Harvey.
I dream big, I shake things up, and I always wear dope suits.
Okay, can anyone tell me what this is called? - Uh, that's a fret.
- Yeah.
And that little thing you got right there-- that's called a capo.
Changes the key.
Uh, maybe you should be in the advanced class? Yeah, maybe I should.
Dude, dumb it down.
But I couldn't possibly, because I'm just a beginner.
I barely haven't even ever seen a "gortar.
" Okay.
We will be working on basic chords for the first four weeks.
Oh, my God.
Four weeks.
I'm already bored.
Of course you are.
You're not challenging yourself.
I suggest we sample a few more classes.
Fine.
Very good.
Good-bye, everybody.
Guess what.
I was secretly an undercover rock star this whole time.
For what it's worth, I think you would make an incredible brunette.
Ron Swanson.
I mean, he's not even attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony of a park that we made together.
I'm sorry, Leslie.
I'm just freaking out.
The only thing we have left is work.
And now he doesn't want to work together anymore? What does that all mean? I think you know what it means.
Yeah.
I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.
No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report-- and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year.
- Leslie, for God's sakes.
- Good idea, Ann.
No, Ann, please, I beg of you.
Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole? Just sit there, let me stare at you while you silently support me on this game plan.
- Leslie-- - Shh-- - Ann - Leslie Your quiet support means the world to me.
As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.
As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together.
So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070.
Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting.
The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail.
So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead.
Hi, I have a question about this project.
Whoa, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's the fire? Let's get to know each other first.
Tell me about your childhood.
Is there going to be basketball there? Basketball courts attract undesirables to my community.
Well, there's barely room for an actual basketball, much less a court.
Because there's a definite type of person I associate with basketball, and I'd rather not have that type of person nearby.
Don't worry.
You don't need to worry.
Okay, I'll just come right out and say it.
I'll tell you what type of person I don't like.
You don't have to do that.
No, no, no, no.
I think we get it.
Yeah, we do, Rose, and you bring up a very good point.
Intolerance.
Can we be doing more? I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about a time when prejudice has touched your lives.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Professor Barnes.
The class I'll be teaching this semester is introduction to lasers.
The word "laser" stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
Where are the lasers? This graphic here represents the electromagnetic spectrum arranged from low frequency He's not even using a laser pointer.
He's right.
This class stinks.
Stick with it.
You might learn something.
Uh, excuse me.
Professor? Hi, there.
Andy Dwyer.
Curious.
When will you be bringing out the lasers for me to play with? And will we start with the small lasers, or could we go just straight to the big lasers, in terms of playing with them? We won't be using actual lasers in this course.
It's about the theory that makes them possible.
One of the most significant bummers of my lifetime.
First up, a personal favorite, the Sopranos option.
Now, I guarantee you, anyone that sees this logo is not gonna "fugghedaboudit.
" This is our current community center.
Ugh.
This is our new community center! That's right, it looks like an apple store.
Today, I'm a Beverly hills plastic surgeon, and the Parks department is a wrinkly old housewife in her early 30s.
I'm about to work a miracle.
Thank you, ma'am.
What a story.
Anyone else? Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something.
No, I don't.
Come on, Mel.
You're always up in arms about something.
No, I'm not.
I'm not always up in arms about something.
There we go.
That's the spirit.
Talk to me about what's bothering you.
Okay, that'll do it.
Thanks, everybody.
I once hosted a forum about a new bike rack that lasted seven hours.
Now when I need these people to complain, they're done in 45 minutes? Whoa, check it out.
You can get credit for playing intramural frisbee golf.
Okay, you can take a class on the Civil War.
Why would I take a class on something that's already happened? Look, you guys have already had your say.
Now I want to try something that I want to try.
And I'm gonna make my choice as I always do, at random.
As she was burned at the stake, Joan of Arc did not cower.
She did not beg for mercy.
she said, in a strong, clear voice, "I am not afraid.
I was born to do this.
" I want to be burned at the stake.
Many societal institutions were established solely to oppress women.
To this day, some feminists have even condemned marriage as a glorified form of slavery.
Amen.
That class was awesome.
I wholeheartedly agree.
If that woman weren't so violently opposed to marriage, I think I would propose to her.
Well, then, it's decided.
Andy Dwyer will be taking "women's lasers.
" "Women's studies.
" Sorry.
God, I cannot stop thinking about lasers.
"Women's studies.
" Is there such thing as "women's lasers"? That'd be my number one pick.
Excuse me, what the heck is going on here? Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusIVE park.
We were told this would have very little impact on the neighborhood.
This flyer has hundreds of events.
There are fireworks every night at midnight? They start at midnight.
Who knows when they're gonna end? Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report.
So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.
I mean, it's all a mystery.
Don't you work for the government? I do, Joe.
Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes.
What can we do about it? I'm glad you asked.
I have some ideas.
These are our current park rangers.
What are they up to? No one cares.
They're boring, and I hate them.
But coming this spring to the style network Ranger Reality Show.
I'm sorry, tom, but Chris, he just wanted us I mean, really, you've gone way off track.
Well, guess what, Jerry? I'm a dreamer.
Okay? I dream big.
Deal with it.
Tom, weekends are for dreaming.
You are a government worker.
This is a government job.
Plus isn't dreaming big exactly what got you in trouble with your old company? - Hey, where you going, Joe? - Bathroom break.
No, get back over there.
I'll find you a bottle or something.
Where did all these people come from? And why did they turn so quickly on this project? Well, you know how it goes.
It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.
I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report.
They are explicitly demanding it.
Hey, everybody, listen up.
Uh, in response to your complaints, we are cancelling all of these disruptive events.
This park is just gonna be a quiet patch of grass, harming nobody.
Everybody cool? Great.
Dream team.
Actually, Chris, I know you think that we're a dream team-- Dream team! Yeah.
But we're not.
You see, Leslie here is a team of one.
And that might be a very good team, but she kind of steamrolls the rest of her team, me, to do whatever she wants.
Regardless of how the rest of her team, me, feels.
So I don't think we should work together anymore.
Wow.
That was very hard to hear.
So many negative words.
I just need to process this.
Okay, the dream team is dead.
But you guys had a great run.
Oh, and the park is open.
Yay! Good job with that.
Hello ma'am, who is just as equal as man, I would like one ticket for, uh, women.
He would like to register for Women's studies.
Okay.
Here's the registration form.
Ooh! And we'll need a check or money order for $940.
Why? Why didn't you tell me it was so expensive? I didn't know.
My parents pay for my classes.
I'll just have them pay for yours too.
Oh, God, no! That's embarrassing.
I know.
I'm gonna beg for money in the street like a drug addict.
- No.
- Yeah.
Oh my God.
Everything in my life is going wrong right now.
Whose fault is this? I demand to know.
Actually-- Ben thinks that I'm a steamroller? That's unbelievable.
How dare he think that I'm a steamroller? Leslie, I'm just telling you this-- I know, he's going through a phase right now, and eventually we're gonna both be friends again.
No, what I was gonna say is that you really are-- Working too hard.
I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing-- You're a steamroller! You are a massive, enormous, runaway steamroller with no brakes and a cement brick on the gas pedal.
You made me watch all eight Harry Potter movies.
I don't even like Harry Potter.
That's insane.
You love Harry Potter.
You've seen all eight movies! When we go out to a bar, you order my drinks for me.
Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache.
Well, it's my headache! Leslie, you do what you want, you ignore what other people want, and you hear only what you want to hear.
Okay.
I know.
I know I do this.
I'm the worst.
No, you're very passionate.
You just push too hard sometimes.
Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller.
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay.
Is it? Honestly, is it? I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone.
That's what he says he wants.
Okay.
Well, this steamroller is hangin' up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine.
What do you-- what do you call that? - The roller? - Probably.
Okay.
Got you a little pick-me-up, Tommy.
A triple-decker ham and cheese from the cafeteria.
Always makes me feel better.
Two pathetic guys eating pathetic sandwiches.
Sounds terrific.
I guess I'm Jerry now.
After work, I'll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a home-cooked meal with my three beautiful daughters.
What a miserable life.
I have been here, well, 30-some years, and the best way to cope with this job is to do everything the exact same way every day.
Heck, I still use my original I.
D.
Card from my first day on the job.
Check this out.
Oh, my God.
I got to go.
Put my sammie in the fridge.
Mouse Rat CD, $30.
Candy bars, $50.
$50.
God, people here are so cheap.
April, where have you been? Over two phone calls came in unimpeded.
We're raising money for my college education, Ron.
I took a second job back at my old job.
Do you want a shoe shine? It's $100.
Laugh all you want, Kyle.
I already took the money out of your wallet.
Oh.
Good news, son.
You have just won a Ron Swanson scholarship.
I don't think so.
I don't remember applying for-- No, An--Andy.
Ron Swanson Scholarship.
Wait, are you serious? Stop this.
No.
Stop, or you lose the money.
Why not? I like the kid, and I have the money.
One thing I promised myself when I buried gold in my backyard was that I'd never be a hoarder or a miser about it.
Hey.
Okay, is this health department business or Leslie business? You need to go talk to her.
Why? So she can force me to spend time with her again? No.
No way.
I'm done talking.
Listen, I know she can be strong-willed and difficult, okay? She once made me eat an entire cheesecake at a potluck so she didn't look bad.
But I really think she's ready to listen.
You ate an entire cheesecake? Why didn't you just throw it away? Because with everything she's done for me, I would eat ten cheesecakes for her.
Also, P.
S.
, it was delicious and amazing, like everything she does.
Will you please just talk to her? For my sake? I don't have unlimited texting, and when she can't talk to you, she texts me.
So we take the old logo from the 1970s, and we make limited-edition hats, posters, t-shirts, everything.
People love limited editions, plus parents will get swept up in the nostalgia and want to go to the parks to recreate the fun they had growing up.
This is amazing.
It is possibly the best idea anyone has had in this government in 100 years.
Tom, terrific.
Thanks, but most of the credit goes to my number-four, Jerry.
He shared some words of wisdom with me today, and while he was yammering on about whatever, I happened to see his old I.
D.
Card.
Thanks, buddy.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come.
Well, I got very curious when you only left me one voicemail message, instead of your usual 20.
I'm trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate.
Here, have a seat.
But only if you want to.
Okay.
I want to.
I never listened to what you wanted, or how you wanted us to be when things Ended between us.
I just decided what I wanted, and I got upset when you didn't want the same thing.
I know that's not fair, and I'm very sorry.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.
If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand.
I--I don't want that.
Really.
But I just think it's for the best.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
There is another option.
We could just say "screw it" and do this thing for real.
What? I miss you like crazy.
I think about you all the time.
I want to be with you.
So let's just say "screw it.
" No, we would have to tell Chris.
Yeah.
It could turn into a scandal.
- Yeah.
- It could hurt your campaign.
I mean, how would you imagine we do this? I don't know.
But I--I know how I feel, and I want to be with you.
But I'm done steamrolling people.
This is how I feel.
How do you feel? First day.
You ready? As ready as I'll ever be.
Oh, crap, I forgot my books.
And my computer.
Just pay attention to the lecture and enjoy.
My first day of college, my father dropped me off at the steel mill.
He didn't think I should go to college.
But I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot.
I hope Andy does too.
We need to start teaching women football, teaching women U.
F.
C.
, teaching them to drive trucks without crashing.
"Hey, maybe I'm only sexy.
"Then--maybe that's all you see, "but at least you can give me extra money.
"Tip money and stuff.
I'll flirt with you, write my name on a napkin.
" They're gonna do it in a right, kind of legal way that empowers prostitution.
We don't rest until we get that.
That will be progress.
That is extremely incorrect.
I thought-- I thought maybe it was when I was-- I, uh-- I'll get 'em next time.
Back to you, Professor.
April! Listen, I was trying to buy this hand-crafted mahogany wood model of a B-25 Mitchell Panchito aircraft.
- Aw, for me? - Don't sass me.
And I went to this website, and this ad popped up that said "Hey, Ron Swanson! Check out this great offer.
" What's your question? My question is, what the hell? Like, how did they know who you are? - Yeah.
- Okay.
Um, there are these things called cookies, where, like you go to a site and buy something, it'll remember you and then create ads for other stuff you might want to buy.
So it learns information? About me? That seems like an invasion of privacy.
Dude, if you think that's bad, go to Google Earth and type in your address.
The point is, Ben and I have been dating on and off for about a year.
I am, of course, shocked And not just because Ben usually prefers tall brunettes.
We're very sorry for the position this puts you in.
What's happening? Are you hugging me, or are we fighting? Are you hugging or fighting? Let me know.
Neither of those things.
I love both of you.
You are exemplary government employees.
"Exemplary"? That's the word we were thinking of.
- Well, it's true.
- Isn't it? Which makes what I'm about to say even sadder.
Then don't say it.
I'm launching a full investigation into the extent of your wrongdoing.
Please report Monday first thing to the council chambers for your ethics trial and subsequent punishment.
I told you we'd feel better.
Hey.
It's 6:30 in the morning.
Your hearing doesn't start for another two hours.
Well, I wanted to get here early, you know, get a feel of the room.
- So you got here-- - 3:00 A.
M.
I couldn't sleep anyway.
Well, I wanted to sneak in before you got here-- an absurd pipe dream I now realize was impossible.
Is that a present for me? Yeah.
What do you think? Li'l Sebastian.
Yeah, I had him made for you at the toy store.
Aw, thank you so much for making my life so wonderful.
- You're welcome.
- I was talking to him.
- Of course.
- But also to you.
Thanks.
I wish we could go through this together.
Look, it's going to be okay.
You're just gonna get a slap on the wrist, maybe a brief suspension.
That's not okay.
That's gonna go on my permanent record.
I'm not the kind of person that has a permanent record.
For me, a slap on the wrist is like a kick to the nuts.
I know it is.
What's gonna happen to you? Don't worry about me.
Well, look, I'll be outside all day, right on the other side of that wall.
So, if you miss me, you just look at this Wrinkled, hideous monster and you'll know I'm sitting there - rooting for you, okay? - Okay.
All right.
- Go.
- Okay.
Marcus Everett Langley was Pawnee's greatest lawyer at the turn of the century.
His nickname was "Old Stone Face" because of his steely demeanor and because he got in an accident at the rock quarry and dynamite blew up his face.
Leslie Knope! Good morning! It is snowing outside.
Isn't that great? You seem like you're in a good mood.
Actually, I'm quite miserable.
I admire and respect you, and dragging you through an ethics trial is filling me with sadness.
I have never felt so low.
Well, you're radiating pure joy.
I went to my herbalist and got two B-12 shots.
And then I ate an unreasonable amount of St.
John's wort, and my herbalist took this weird bee pollen paste rubbed it around my gums.
And now my mouth feels like a spaceship.
This is stressful.
And stress leads to depression.
And if I don't mantain an extremely high dosages of herbal remedies, I will get very depressed.
Oh, God.
It's happening right now.
We are here today to determine whether Leslie Knope violated any municipal rules or laws due to her romantic relationship with her superior Ben Wyatt, whose hearing will be held tomorrow.
Would you like to make a statement at this time? Yes.
I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule.
But we did nothing else wrong or unethical.
In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle exposed her elbow outdoors, which was a class "A" felony.
Although she felt the law unjust, she acknowledged that she had broken it, and she nobly accepted her punishment-- to be set adrift on Lake Michigan like a human popsicle.
Look how calm she looks.
That's how I feel-- totally zen.
Ms.
Knope, on what day did your relationship with Ben Wyatt begin? Last May, at your request, Ben and I drove to Indianapolis to bid for the state little league tournament.
The night we returned was the first time we kissed each other on each other's mouths.
It was excellent.
That was unnecessary to add.
I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.
Next question-- did you ever receive special treatment as a result of your relationship with Ben Wyatt? I received adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.
Oh, you mean professionally.
No.
And did you break any local, state, or federal law in an effort to cover up your relationship with Ben Wyatt? Absolutely not.
Thank you.
Ms.
Knope, that is all.
Mr.
Traeger, this says you're gonna be calling 14 witnesses.
Is that correct? Uh, yes, sir.
Why so many? I've already admitted that I broke your rule.
It's not my rule, Leslie.
It is an important rule that exists in every government.
Romantic relationships between superiors and their employees lead to fraud, corruption, and misuse of public funds.
And you think I'm guilty of that? I think that you began your relationship with Ben Wyatt earlier than you're saying.
I believe that you certainly received special treatment, and I think that you may even be guilty of bribery.
None of those things are true.
And I will prove it, Mr.
Traeger.
Okay, ten-minute break please.
Here you go, boss.
Okay, guys, we need to counter every charge that Chris has leveled against me.
- Andy, I need evidence.
- Got it! Wait! You don't know what evidence.
Ah, right on.
Yes.
Hit me.
Next to my desk is a picture of a female politician-- Bella Abzug.
Get the key that's taped to the back of that picture.
It opens up my bottom desk drawer in there are some files-- pay attention.
Where are you looking? Look here, focus here.
Get the files in the drawer, and then get all the file boxes in the office.
Put the files in the drawer.
Let's go.
- No.
- Okay, I'll go with him.
Thank you.
Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses.
I need you to talk to all the department heads and find out who's gonna testify.
I don't know the names of the other department heads.
I'll go with him.
Seriously? With the men in this office? - Ann? - Yeah? I need you to text me every 30 seconds - that everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.
Thanks, Ann! I broke one rule, and I will accept a slap on the wrist.
But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.
You go down in history as a frozen whore.
I'm fighting.
Hey, grab my computer.
I'm all set.
- Great.
You're up next.
- How is Ben? Is he sad? - You need to cheer him up, Ann.
- Ben is fine.
He says he's sorry he's not in here.
He said to look at the monster.
I'm hoping you know what that means.
There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.
How? Why? That makes no sense.
There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong-- unless someone's planning to lie or slander us.
Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him.
- With pleasure.
- Wait.
Let me make it clear.
Don't silence him.
Just make sure he can't talk.
Okay, we're back.
Clear this chamber, please.
Ms.
Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned when my relationship with Ben Wyatt began.
I'd like to direct you to your inbox and specifically an email entitled "yay".
That's Y-A and 18 "Y"s and 44 exclamation points.
Yes, it is an email from you.
Oh, and there's an attachment.
Mm.
Intriguing.
Could you play the attachment, please? Sure.
In a world on the brink of financial meltdown In a town unlike any other An adorable man with a cute face and the future president of the United States-- what?-- went from being friends to being so much more.
Ann! Ben and I hooked up last night! Aah! And I learned how to use iMovie.
Call me later! Bye! So what was the date you received that email? - Uh, May 12th.
- May 12th The day after we returned from Indianapolis.
Mr.
Haverford, would you consider Leslie Knope a good employee? Did Tom Ford turn around the House of Gucci? I do not know, but I'll assume that that is a yes.
How long were you two lovers? - Excuse me? - Oh, God.
Last march, I witnessed Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford engaged in a passionate yet tender kiss.
It seems that Ms.
Knope has a pattern of becoming involved with her co-workers.
Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing? An online dating site randomly paired us up.
So, as a joke, I thought it would be funny to pretend you and I were dating.
And then you kissed me as a joke To shut me up.
But we never had any other romantic contact after that.
No, that would be like dating my older sister's elderly aunt.
No, it wouldn't.
Well, we've been at it for hours.
And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.
I don't know why Leslie Knope's on trial.
Ethel Beavers did it! - Beavers did it! - Sit down.
I will hold myself in contempt of the court! Is this about the laptop? I didn't mean to steal it.
I took it home, and I spaced.
I forgot.
I'm gonna bring it back.
It totally works, but I got spaghetti in the keyboard.
What laptop? Objection.
But other than that, I think I'm winning.
I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.
I have here a receipt from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.
Leslie Knope submitted that receipt for reimbursement.
Taxpayers' money is not meant to be spent on a romantic getaway.
Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us? Um, khakis and button-down shirts-- your basic white people clothes.
And when you walked into the room, what did it look like? Did it look like anything romantic had happened? Oh, hell, no.
I have ruined my share of hotel rooms, and trust me, nothing sexual happened in that room.
It kind of looked like an office.
Maybe because it was an office.
City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an all-nighter.
The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.
I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off big-time.
And by the way, we got the gramps-- grants.
God! Oh.
It was gonna be such an awesome moment.
So, Ethel, you've been to a million of these ethics trials.
- What do you think my chances are? - I'd say it's 50/50.
You want to put money on it, I'll give you 60/40 against.
Is it ethical for a court stenographer to bet on the outcome of a hearing? You tell me.
You're the one on trial.
Ron Swanson to the stand, please.
Mr.
Swanson, there has been a question posed about when my relationship with Ben Wyatt ended.
Can you confirm that you own a cabin - at 930-- - Ah! Stop, please.
I don't like to give out my address to anyone, much less have it on an official record.
Ron, don't be ridiculous.
This is very important.
- Do you own a cabin-- - Ah! - 9301 Cedarcrest Dr-- - Beep! I didn't hear that.
She's here.
Who's here? My ex-wife--Tammy two.
I can smell the sulfur coming off her cloven hooves.
Good nose, Ron.
Tammy Swanson is here.
She'll be my next witness.
Tammy two is your killer witness? Please! You're gonna have to do better-- Actually, she is a terrifying sociopath who could say or do anything-- A pretty good killer witness.
Ms.
Swanson, do you, as you claimed, have evidence linking Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt to law breaking? Absolutely.
I have several photographs that will definitively prove-- May I remind you that you are under oath, and if you lie, I will fire you and have you prosecuted.
Nothing.
They will definitively prove nothing.
You cut me off.
I don't have any evidence.
Oh, Chris-- so silly.
Okay, bye, guys.
Leslie, have fun with this trial.
Yay! I think I've proven that the only rule Ben and I broke was dating each other.
And I am very happy that I have not uncovered any additional evidence of unethical behavior.
But I-I do have one last witness-- George Williams from Public Works.
George Williams? Who's-- Oh, George Williams-- He's just a maintenance worker, NASCAR enthusiast, I believe.
And, oh, interesting tidbit-- I once bribed him to keep my relationship with Ben quiet.
You're saying that you saw Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope kissing at Li'l Sebastian's memorial? Yeah! Can you identify Leslie Knope in this chamber? - She's right there.
- Right-- And what happened after this incident? Well, I got real nervous.
They came up to me, and they told me to forget what I saw.
What you saw was not what you think it is.
I have a gift certificate, actually, for you.
Oh, my God.
And then they gave me a $50 gift certificate to a spa and said And thank you for your discretion.
- And did you use it? - Yeah.
I got a facial.
My wife said my skin was luminous.
That's enough.
Now, in order to cover up their illicit affair, Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope bribed a city employee.
George, I notice that you're wearing glasses, yet on the day in question, I don't recall you wearing glasses.
Could it be because you weren't wearing glasses? I never wear 'em on the job.
Can you take your glasses off, please, and read this for us? "I could read this if I weren't so blind.
" Well, that went terribly.
I need to check some facts and figures.
I would like to request a 55-day recess.
You can have 30 minutes, but we're nearing the end here, Ms.
Knope.
Okay, guys, my only hope is that in one of these old books, there's some weird, arcane statute or government rule that helps me.
So everybody grab a volume, and let's just read up.
Okay, mine doesn't have any pictures.
Does anyone have anything? Did anybody find anything good? In 1856, the city council banned all sexual positions except for missionary.
And two years later, they banned missionary.
speak out of turn, he may be caned across the shinbone.
Oh, my God.
Black people still can't legally use city sidewalks.
Look, I know we're not supposed to be seen together, but I think Ben could be really helpful with this.
- Can somebody go get him? - All right, I'll go.
"Any woman caught laughing is a witch.
" That's true.
Um, he's not there.
No, he said he'd just be on the other side of that wall.
- He's probably in the bathroom.
- All right, I'll find him.
This mural is called Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee.
All the terrible things that have happened in this town's history are on one side.
And on the other side are all the good things that have happened.
I'm on the bad side.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am, Ron.
I'm guilty.
I did something bad.
I'm a bad person.
It's not that simple.
You know what makes a good person good? When a good person does something bad, they own up to it.
They try to learn something from it, and they move on.
Guys, everybody stop reading-- no more loopholes, no more fighting.
Are you sure, boss? Yeah.
I know I let you down.
And I just want to say I'm really sorry.
Leslie, what are you talking about? Yeah, this makes me like you more.
Bribing someone to hide a sexcapade-- I'm proud to call you a friend.
And I always liked you.
Okay, we're back.
Clear the chamber, please.
I think I'm about to get fired, Ron.
Ms.
Knope, unless you have any objections, we'll be ending this investigation and moving on to the punishment phase.
I have no objections.
We hereby hand down the following judgment.
You will be suspended for two weeks with pay.
- Just two weeks? - Correct.
This concludes the investigation.
I thought I was gonna get fired.
I should've gotten fired.
Why didn't I get fired? Ben asked for a private meeting with the committee, and he took full responsibility for the bribe and resigned, effective immediately.
What? Wait.
Hang on.
You can't let him resign.
I tried to talk him out of it, but His mind was made up.
Look, my job is to protect the government from fraud and corruption.
I was just doing my job.
I hope that you can understand that.
I do.
Honestly, I do.
'Cause your actions wounded me to my core, which is not easy since the bulk of my workouts are focused on core strengthening.
But we will get through this.
You are An excellent government employee.
And more importantly, you're the only person I've ever met who's worthy of being Ben's girlfriend.
I hope that's true.
You know, the meeting that Ben and I had-- it's on the record.
You should take a look at the last page of the transcript.
"Mr.
Wyatt: Chris, for God's sake, "would you mind not jumping for a while?" Mr.
Traeger: "Sorry, Ben, but" This is how I fight depression.
Okay, fine.
I'll stop.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are prepared to resign, effective immediately, and take full responsibility for all the events that transpired at Li'l Sebastian's memorial.
- "Mr.
Wyatt: That is correct.
" - That is correct.
"Mr.
Traeger: Okay, fine.
"This makes me sadder than I previously thought "humanly possible, but I accept your resignation.
Can I ask you one more question?" Was all of this-- all the sneaking around, the scandal, losing your job-- Was it worth it? Yes.
It was.
"Because I love Leslie.
I want to be with her.
"And I don't want to hide "the way I feel about her anymore.
"So, yeah, it was worth it, "because I'm in love with Leslie Knope.
"Mr.
Traeger: That was beautiful.
"I'm literally crying and jumping.
"Crying noise, crying noise, nose blow.
"Mr.
Wyatt: It's gonna be okay.
Mr.
Traeger:" Oh.
Let it out, I guess.
"End transcript.
" Hi, honey, how was your day? Oh, I've had better.
How about you? I can't believe you did that for me.
Well, I was pretty sure it was gonna happen one way or the other.
I hope it doesn't affect your campaign.
Don't worry about that right now.
There was a piece of testimony that came out during the trial that I think you'd be interested in.
Ethel? Ethel, could you please read page 132 of the official testimony? "Ethel Beavers: The official record "has now annoyingly been reopened "so that Leslie Knope can make a statement.
"Leslie Knope: Let the record state that I, Leslie Knope, "love Ben Wyatt.
"I love him with all of my heart.
"Did you get that? Ethel Beavers: Yes, I got it.
" Thank you, Ethel.
Can I get a ride home? It's freezing.
Can you please state your name for the committee? - Gary Gergich.
- Oh, God, Jerry.
You can't even get your own name right.
Actually, my real name is Gary.
Gary? On my first day here, the old director-- he called me Jerry, and I just didn't think I should correct him.
That's ridiculous.
Your name is Jerry.
No.
Legally my name is Gary.
Gary Gergich? Jerry Gergich.
Gary Gergich.
Jerry Gergich.
Gary Gergich.
Jerry-- God, they're both horrible.
But Jerry's better.
I'm gonna call you Jerry.
Okay, Jerry, do you remember a time I'm sorry.
I can't get over the Gary/Jerry thing.
Neither can I.
Jerry, you can go.
We need a five-minute break.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Leslie Knope! - Hey, Chris! Wow, is that a new jogging shirt? It is! It's an experimental fabric called bumble-flex.
It's made out of synthetic bees' wings.
- That's cool.
- Anyway You're not supposed to be here.
You're suspended.
I totally understand that.
I'm just going to, uh, take my flash drive and I'll do some work from home.
N O.
You are specifically prohibited from doing your job.
Oh, I'm not gonna do my job.
I'm just gonna oversee the department, and check in on the parks, and attend any meetings that require - the deputy director.
- Leslie.
Go home and give me the flash drive.
This is a nasal spray.
Give me the flash drive.
Give me the nasal spray.
On three.
One - Two - Two Three.
Okay, good.
Now, in two weeks, you can-- Leslie Knope! I am much faster than you! I have bumble-flex! It's so nice to be able to sit here in public - and have breakfast with you.
- Yeah.
In a way, my suspension from work was kind of a blessing.
Yeah, I feel the same way about resigning in disgrace.
Totally, the key is you have to keep yourself busy, or else you're gonna go crazy.
I mean, look at me, look how busy I am.
I'm inventing a new spice called "sal-gar.
" It's part salt, part sugar.
What could that possibly be good on? - Butterscotch pudding.
- Fair enough.
Okay, I have to go to this meeting with my advisers.
You have a big day, right? Which interview is this? It's a job doing in-house accounting work for an accounting firm, so could be pretty interesting.
Yeah, sounds interesting.
You know, if I hadn't resigned in disgrace, I might never have explored the private sector.
It's like, why didn't I resign in disgrace 12 years ago? You might want to stop saying "resigned in disgrace.
" Especially during job interviews.
Good call.
Leslie wishes she could be here herself to give you these presents, but she's suspended.
Oh, and also she said that they're not from her, - they're from Santa Claus.
- Can I go first? Mouse Rat, certified gold! Over 100 copies sold in Pawnee! I need to get a picture of me holding this so I can frame it.
Personalized, leopard-printed robe.
Pink feather cuffs.
And on the back, in rhinestones "You can get it"! I know you're sad you couldn't get tickets to the "Watch the Throne" tour, so I got you a watch and a tiny throne instead.
And check it out, she even took out the dumb clock part and put this in "Baller Time.
" These are the Black-eyed Peas.
And I finally killed them.
It's a Christmas miracle.
Every year, I give Leslie the same present I give everyone: A crisp $20 bill.
And every year, she gets me something thoughtful and personal.
It makes me furious.
This year, she outdid herself.
She had it installed over the weekend.
It's so-- It's so beautiful.
We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift-giving imbalance.
Everyone start thinking of ideas.
Aw, jeez.
Socks.
She gets me.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.
Sorry I'm late.
I was off getting holiday gifts for my team.
William, here is a Knope 2012 tree ornament.
- Hey.
- And Elizabeth, I got you a Knope 2012 MenorahMaybe? - No.
- No, okay.
Then I got you a tree ornament.
Okay, so let's talk about damage control.
Now, I could go on Pawnee Today, but-- and I know this is a long shot-- Oprah has her own network now.
- Whoa, Leslie, slow down.
- The first step is for us to figure out what we're up against, and we've already got polls out in the field, and we should have results back in a couple of days.
Just stay out of the spotlight until we can figure out just how this, uh, incident has affected the voters.
Sit tight, take a beat, relax.
"Sit tight"? "Take a beat"? "Relax"? I don't really do any of those things.
In fact, while I was in that meeting, I was also planning my mother's birthday party in my head.
Strawberry margaritas! Another use for sal-gar! Financial analysis, automated general ledger accounting systems, audit management.
Hmm, you've done everything.
Well, they call me "the Swiss Army Accountant.
" - They don't call me that.
- They should.
Well, look, I think you'd be a great addition.
Would you be willing to come back to meet the division head? Yes, absolutely.
- We'll set that up.
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.
- Well, uh Calc-you-later.
Oh, you like that one, huh? We do not get a lot of humor here, and when we do, it's wonderful.
- Oh.
- Ted! Come in here! Say it to Ted when he comes in.
We could get Leslie some marshmallow fluff.
I have some right here.
Correction, darling.
You had some right here.
Did you just scoop it out of the jar with your hand like a bear? Yes.
I can't get it off.
Can you help me? Behold! My latest attempt to drag this department into the 20th century.
- Tom, it's the 21st century.
- I know.
I'd settle for getting you into the 20th.
I fed all of Leslie's emails, letters, and memos into a program and generated A word cloud.
This is how we can get gift ideas.
The more she's mentioned a word, the larger it appears.
"Ben" And much larger, "Ann.
" - She definitely loves Ann.
- Aww.
Okay.
I have an idea.
I will build a small wood model of the parks department.
We can decorate our offices as they are in real life.
It will be - Cute.
- Wait! Better idea: We make a gingerbread version of the office.
- That's so good! - I think the wood model is-- and we can decorate our offices with candy canes and gumdrops! That would be so adorable! Thanks, Ron! That's such a cute idea! I have some great red birch with a nice spalting.
I already have some scale wainscoting.
Mmm, I love me a calzone.
Ben! I'm going crazy! First, they won't let me work in the parks department, now they won't let me campaign either.
All I want to do is improve our town, and they won't let me do that! You're putting an awful lot of sal-gar on your pasta.
This is just sugar.
Okay, I need you to distract me.
Talk to me about something.
Anything.
Well, that accounting firm is gonna make me a job offer.
Oh, yeah? That's great! - Yeah.
- Are you gonna take it? Well, it pays well.
The commute is a little long, but that's okay.
I didn't love the carpeting, but eh.
You know what I think? If you don't love it, take a month.
See what else is out there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, you know, you can still improve the city.
You can't work right now, or run a campaign.
- Do it as a private citizen.
- Oh, my God.
I'll form a citizen action committee, I'll lobby from the outside, I'll harness the power of the community.
Oh, my God, I finally have some work to do.
Thank you so much for dinner, honey.
I can hear you breathing, and, yes, you can finish her pasta.
Thank God.
I'm so hungry.
Mmm, it tastes like froot loops.
Wow! Great turn out.
Okay, welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Parks Committee of Pawnee, or PCP.
Um, should we really be called "PCP"? - See, because-- - Yes, because, like the drug PCP, we are so fast-acting and powerful, we should be illegal.
Now, what do you want to see fixed in the parks? Yes? I've noticed that the White Hills hiking path could really use some upkeep.
I was thinking we organize a letter-writing campaign.
Uh, I-I know for a fact that nobody in the parks department reads letters, except for one person, who is amazing, but s-he isn't currently there, because he was suspended.
How amazing can he be if he got suspended? Pretty damn amazing, Diane.
Now shush.
If we want to get the government off their bloated, bureaucratic butts, then we need our voices to be heard, and that's what we're gonna do.
Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
Ron is making the model, and then we're going to put all of our candy decorations in our corners of the office.
Okay, so what did everybody make? Boom! Rock n' roll candy Andy.
Wow.
- Mmm.
- That's really good, son.
I didn't do anything for my office.
It's okay, I took care of it.
I made a marshmallow Ron Swanson.
See? His arms are crossed because he's mad at all the other marshmallow workers for annoying him.
You like it? It's fine.
When I was trying to decide how to decorate my office, I had to ask myself, "what kind of candy should I choose?" Obviously chocolate, 'cause I'm sweet, smooth, and the ladies love me.
Now the question still remained, "what kind of chocolate am I?" Do I have a little gooey, caramel center? Am I filled with little rice krispies? Maybe I'm white chocolate and I'm bucking all the stereotypes.
Oh, just put your damn candy out.
Ultimately, I decided to go with a little gourmet fudge.
I didn't have time to make it into anything, and please don't eat it 'cause it cost $55 an ounce.
So I made my desk out of silver m&ms.
But they do not make silver m&ms, so I spray-painted them.
Okay, those are poisonous, so no one eat them.
Yeah, duh.
- Go throw up.
- I didn't eat any.
- Go throw up.
- Throw up.
- Ben Wyatt.
- Hi.
- Great to meet you.
- You too.
I'm, uh, this.
Well, thank you for meeting with me, Mr.
Feinstein.
Please, call me Dennis Feinstein.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase, Ben.
This cologne company is my life's work.
Why should I trust you with my perfumery? Well, uh, I've been in government accounting for more than a decade, and I just think it's time for a change.
Listen, Ben, I'm gonna cut right to the chase, okay? I like you-- I've always liked you-- but I also like Eddie.
Ed--who--who's Eddie? Eddie's my current CFO, but I might fire him and hire you.
- You got kids? - No.
That's good.
Dum-dum Eddie has two kids.
Oh, God.
Don't fire Eddie.
Why would you have him in here in this interview? - Eddie, I am sorry-- - Don't talk to Eddie.
Treat him like you would treat a person in another country that you paid $25,000 to hunt.
- What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? I'm talking about the best vacation of my life.
Oh, my God.
Look, I'm sorry.
I-I thought I wanted to branch out a little career-wise, but that was a mistake.
Keep Eddie.
I do not want this job.
You're crazy, man.
We'll be in touch.
Okay, are there any more recommendations for new games at the rec center? My daughter, she loves chutes and ladders.
Oh, come on! There is no strategy to chutes and ladders.
- It's just luck.
- My daughter's five.
Well, your daughter is an idiot.
Her daughter is an idiot! He daughter is an idiot! - No, no, no.
- Her daughter is an idiot! No, no she's not.
Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP.
We have a list of six demands.
Here they are in alphabetical order.
Number one: Ants.
Too many ants in the teen center.
Number two: Tennis court improvements.
- Number three-- - Well, Les--um, ma'am, uh, this public forum, it is just about improvements that we can make to the rec center.
Speaking of which, the fact that yahtzee is not in the rec center is a tragedy on par with human trafficking.
Slight exaggeration Getting back to our demands.
We will not be muzzled like a rabid dog.
We are gonna take this all the way to the top.
Yay! Okay, we have made some waves here, people, but we need to keep this momentum going.
Now, the city manager's name is Chris Traeger.
I want to take this fight to him.
Ooh, a letter-writing campaign! God, Diane, will you stop it with the letter-writing campaign? No.
I have his office number.
I want one of you calling it every 15 minutes.
We are also going to protest along his jogging route, and I need someone in every GNC within a five-mile radius - of the city center.
- But there are only 12 of us.
- 13.
- Look! Our numbers are growing! There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives.
You with me? I can handcraft 17-foot canoes out of western red cedar, but I can't glue two damn Graham crackers together! Look, it's really easy.
I know a lot about candy.
I play with it, I eat it.
Sometimes I play with it and eat it.
Boom! Okay, new plan.
Everyone else makes this candy house, and I make myself useful elsewhere.
Your 11:00 is here.
Concerned citizen and community leader Leslie Knope.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Leslie.
You're not supposed to be here.
As a government employee, that's true, but I am just here as a concerned citizen and founder of PCP.
The Parks Committee of Pawnee.
Those are the people that have been harassing me.
We have many demands.
Specifically, these six unfunded projects that need to be dealt with immediately.
- Well-- - Not good enough! Leslie, out of respect for you, I will meet with your group, but I hope that this puts an end to the madness.
Prepare for battle.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got your Christmas present.
It's like a little stopwatch that records your jogging times and then sends it to your computer via Bluetooth.
Ahh! - That is so thoughtful! - Aww.
My pleasure.
See you in hell! Well, I see you've taken our advice about relaxing.
Oh, this is just a little militant citizen group I slapped together.
But enough about me, what are my polling results? Uh, well, before the scandal, you were at 26%.
Now, we knew we'd take a hit, but we figured as long as we're at 15% or above, we're still in the fight.
And we're at 15%? We went back to 26%? Whoa, wait.
We're at one.
One hundred? You're polling at 1%.
What? No.
That can't be right.
Okay, well, what we do is we move forward from this.
How do we put a positive spin on this? - There's no way to spin this.
- Sure there is.
You're looking at the glass like it's 99% empty.
I'm looking at it like it's 1% full.
You know, the last delicious sip of a milkshake at the bottom of the metal milkshakey thing? It's very hard to come back from this kind of thing.
You know, a sex scandal with your boss.
Oh, like you're so pure and chaste.
Please, I know the two of you are sleeping together.
It's obvious, with all your glances and your sly smiles.
- I'm gay.
- Well, never mind then.
It's a small town.
There's nowhere to hide.
We can't run your campaign anymore.
I'm sorry, Leslie.
You were a great candidate, butit's over.
Could you maybe find new advisors? I can't.
I talked to everyone in the entire state who's ever run a campaign.
Nobody wants a candidate who's polling - at "last milkshake sip" levels.
- Can I say something? This sucks, I am not gonna convince you that it doesn't, and you can tell me every day for the next year - about how much this sucks.
- One year--you said one year.
- That's on the record.
- And I meant it.
But eventually this'll pass.
You're gonna get through this.
I don't know if I'm going to.
I mean, look, I return to my old job in a week, and that's great because I love my old job, but My heart was really set on this new job.
Ann.
Don't touch my pickles, Ann! B-b-b-b-Ben-jammin'! - Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
Hey, Jean-Ralphio.
How's it going? It's going good, I'm actually right here for an appointmt.
Getting a Brazilian.
By the way, there's a woman over there that is unbelievable.
Her name is Kim.
When she rips it off, she smiles, and it makes you feel things.
Throw my name, I get a referral discount.
- If you don't mind.
- Okay.
I heard somebody resigned in disgrace.
My question to you is, how you making that paper? Oh, well, I've interviewed around, uh, but I'm actually about to take a job doing in-house accounting - for an accounting firm.
- Buh I almost fell asleep during that sentence.
- Okay.
- Let me get this straight.
You would be an accountant - For accountants? - Yeah.
So at this accounting firm, you would have the boring job? Are you nuts? This is probably the first time you've had off since you've been kid president.
- True or false? - True.
Why don't you use that time and go after one of your passions, like model trains or, like, or toy Gandalfs or something? I don't know why you jumped straight to model trains.
I mean it's accurate.
I'm gonna tell you something that I once heard from a very, - very smart woman named Kim.
- The lady who waxes you? She told me, "if you don't love what you do Then why do it?" Then she ripped the hair from my b-hole.
Ron filled me in on everything that happened, and I really wish that the ethics investigation hadn't interfered with your campaign in any way.
You don't have to apologize.
You were very fair.
In fact, I'm the one that needs to apologize.
I got you involved in PCP.
But I'm starting a new group now, LSD-- Leslie's Sorry Division-- and I just want to say I'm sorry, Chris.
Oh, that's nice of you to say.
Anyway, now, for your Christmas present.
Your suspension's been lifted.
Please, come back to work.
Thank you.
Hey, what are you doing here? Hey.
Uh, I just wanted to tell you something in person.
Oh, my God, I'm pregnant.
Wait, what? No, that's not it.
I turned down that accounting job.
Just didn't feel right.
That's okay, right? Yeah.
I think that's great.
- I'm really proud of you.
- Yeah? What are you gonna do instead? - I have no idea.
- I like it.
Okay, well, I guess I'll just see you at home.
Well, they're having a party in here.
Why don't you stay? Actually, I think you should go in alone.
- What's going on here? - Merry Christmas, Leslie! We made you this replica of the parks department out of gingerbread.
Oh, my God, I love it! Aw, I love it, and I love you guys, and Ann specifically.
And all of you! You did all of this together? Yes, except for me.
Turns out, I cannot make a gingerbread house, which would bother me if I were an 8-year-old girl.
In any case, these people stepped up and helped me out, and that gave me another idea.
This is the city council chambers, and that's you, next may.
I don't understand.
Your campaign advisers quit, big deal.
You're running for city council again, Leslie, with our help.
April Ludgate, youth outreach and director of new media.
Tom Haverford, image consultant, swagger coach.
Ann Perkins, office manager and volunteer coordinator.
Andy Dwyer, security, sweets, body man.
Javelin, if need be.
Donna Meagle, transpo, AKA rides in my Benz.
W--you guys didn't tell me we were doing this.
I--I did not know that I was supposed to come up with something.
I-- Ron Swanson, any other damn thing you might need.
Guys, it's so much work.
I can't ask you to put your lives on hold.
Find one person here who you haven't helped by putting your life on hold.
I don't know what to say Except Let's go win an election! Giving Christmas gifts is like a sport to me.
Finding or making that perfect something.
- Come on.
- It's also like a sport to me because I always win.
This year, though? My friends won.
In fact, I got my ass handed to me.
- Welcome, Mr.
Saperstein.
- Thank you so much.
I will just show to your cubicle.
I can't wait.
I bet it's a big one, - huh Barney? - Um, the, uh, temp agency said that you are fluent with Quickbooks Pro, correct? Oh, right, yeah, we should cover that.
You see, my resume might not actually be accurate, right? So I have no idea what you're talking about.
Don't know what Quickbooks are.
You don't have any accounting experience? No, no, no, Barney, come on.
But you don't have to be an accountant to know that this girl is a ten.
Yo, what up, D.
S.
? You come here often? To my job? Ooh, she got a mouth on her also.
- Shut it.
- Is this the new temp who's supposed to help me with the spreadsheets? You want to talk about spreading and sheets, we can go back to my place and I will rock your-- - You're fired! - That makes sense.
So I just go out the same way I came in? 
Oh, goody, you're all here.
Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk about my campaign in the office, but last night I've made a decision about who should be my campaign manager.
This is a huge job.
This is going to require a lot of late night, one-on-one jam sessions with me, and we're going to bounce ideas off of each other, you're going to have to take calls for me, any time, day or night.
The person I have chosen is, drum roll please, Ann Perkins! Yay! Give it up for Ann! Good choice.
Leslie, I don't know the first thing about running a political campaign.
Ann, you beautiful tropical fish.
You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.
You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.
No, I haven't.
- You haven't? - No! You will.
You're that good of a nurse.
What about Ben? I mean, he ran for mayor at 18 and won.
Ben is poison in my campaign.
Our relationship is the reason why my advisors pulled out.
- I-- - Ann, don't listen to your head or your heart.
Just look at my eyes and say "yes.
" - Okay, yes.
- Yes! - I believe in you, Ann.
- Thank you.
And your first job as my campaign manager is to start dressing like one.
I don't want to have this conversation again.
Again? You just hired me eight seconds ago.
Wow.
You're doing a really bad job.
- William, Elizabeth.
- Leslie, hi.
Hi.
What are you-- Are you coming to see me? Did you hear that I'm relaunching my campaign? Actually, no, sorry.
We weren't here to see you.
We've been meeting with other potential candidates for city council.
Oh, really? So, my campaign ends and, just like that, you find someone else and run theirs? Yes, that's our job.
I know.
Good luck, but, uh, I just had a big meeting with my new advisory board, and they're brilliant and amazing.
They're real killers.
Leslie, I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything.
Thank you, Andy.
I'll be right in.
Well, uh, good luck, Leslie.
Honestly.
Well, we don't need luck.
We are a rocket ship.
We are relaunching, and we're going to blast past your cann-- Huh, they're gone.
It's true--I no longer have highly-trained, professional campaign managers.
So what? Are most murders committed by highly-trained, professional assassins? No.
They're committed by friends and coworkers.
That analogy was way better in my head.
Hi.
Champion? Oh my gosh, there you are, puppy.
- That's a good boy.
- That is a three-legged dog.
His name is Champion, because he's the dog world champion.
Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry, but how many legs did that dog have when you found him? Three! That's what makes him the best.
He can do more with three legs than most dogs can do with four.
Except for digging.
He's really bad at digging.
And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house? You want to be involved.
We get that, so You just say the word, and Champion goes back to the pound, where he can be put down and killed forever.
I'm not gonna send a three-legged dog to his death.
Yes! But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.
Well, it would be nice if you helped a little.
Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs.
Cruel, but fair.
So Leslie and I have come up with the theme for the campaign relaunch rally.
"The Comeback Kid.
" Everyone loves a good comeback story.
Rocky.
Robert Downey, Jr.
Terminator said, "I'll be back," and he was.
Also making a comeback-- the casual Hawaiian shirt.
Well, well, well, look, who's ahead of the curve.
I was joking.
You should soak that in bleach and burn it.
Okay, so, the rally's going to be held tomorrow at the Pawnee Sports Building.
April, you finalized a rental, right? Shut up, Ann.
I told you never to talk to me.
That was Champion.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Bad dog! Yes, everything's fine with the rental.
Ron, you're constructing the stage? Yes, ma'am.
Leslie wanted to hire a contractor to build a stage.
I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief.
Seal the edges by crimping the fork--aw, crap.
Ed! What's up, Chris? Come on in, man.
I already did.
So, uh, how you been? How are you doing? - How are you? - Great, actually.
I'm just learning how to make a "cali-zoin-za.
" Or, as you Americans like to say, calzones.
- Do you want one? - No, I find calzone fatty, and unnecessary.
So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch, and I care about you, so I just want to make sure you're doing okay.
Chris, honestly, I'm great.
I'm just exploring whatever fun activity pops into my brain.
Like, check this out.
I'm teaching myself how to do Claymation videos.
Isn't this just so cool? It is so cool! Ben is massively depressed, and he needs my help.
You look like a real campaign manager.
Oh, thanks, that's because I googled "campaign manager" and noticed that they wear a lot of dark colors.
See, there's more things to look at on the Internet - besides naked guys, Ann.
- What? I need a team update, campaign manager.
Okay.
Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.
I still can't believe that you got him.
Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.
In 1992, Pistol Pete's last-second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages.
Team mascot later changed.
Akash, buddy, of course I came to you first.
You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.
But here's my question-- Do your carpets match your drapes? How do you make any event classy on a budget? Red carpet.
My entire apartment is red carpet.
On top of that, leading into my bedroom, a second red carpet.
Oh, what's this in my shoe? Red carpet insole.
Everywhere I go, I'm walking on red carpet.
Is there even enough room for everyone? - Here, sit on my lap.
- No, that's humiliating.
Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap? No, that's Champion's spot.
He called it.
Tom, we're already late.
Now, be a man, and sit on that girl's lap.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Pete Disellio.
We can call you Pistol, right? I prefer Pete.
Oh.
Okay, got it.
I'm Leslie Knope.
We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.
You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.
This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Come on in.
Oh, thanks.
- I'm excited to be here.
- Ah! We're excited to have you.
Ann is killing it.
My campaign team is unstoppable.
This rally is going to be awesome.
Oh, my God, I'm feeling it! I'm gonna break dance! Leslie? Coming! Thank God.
Oh, Champion is a way better kisser than you are, babe.
- Nuh-uh! - Yes, he is.
He's even a better kisser than me.
Here, try some.
Okay, stop it.
He's drooling on me! Oh! - This is unsafe.
- Ha ha! Oh, we should do it for the kids.
Kids love it, Ron.
Just for the kids.
Hi, kids! Hey! Oh, look.
The police even love it.
They're sirening back to us.
That's awesome, I was going to tell them that we-- Heard ya, bud! And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, "Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk!" You can still dunk, right? - Oh, I can, but I won't.
- Sorry? Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game.
It feels like I'm living in the past.
But the past is great.
The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster.
Look, Leslie, I read up on you.
You've done great stuff for our parks system and I will happily endorse you As Peter Disellio, regional distributor for Derwin ham loafs, but if this is about who I was, or what I did when I was 17, I'm out of here.
Let's not talk about dunking anymore.
Let's talk about what you want to do.
- Okay.
- I think you want to dunk.
I'm not going to dunk the ball.
What about a layup? Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old.
Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly? Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck.
Okay.
Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law.
I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please? Hi.
I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.
Oh my God, April, that's horrible.
Where are you? "My mother's butt," really? That's really helpful.
Let me talk to her.
April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope.
Do not make any trouble.
Sit tight.
I'm on my way.
- Whoa.
You just hung up on her? - She'd already hung up on me.
Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me.
You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.
Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right? - You'll just make your speech? - He's our surprise headliner.
The whole town loves him.
I'm polling at 1%.
He must dunk, Ann.
Do whatever it takes.
You know, anything short of sexual favors.
- What? - I do not-- I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors.
- I wasn't going to.
- Good, I wouldn't either.
That's where I draw the line.
Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me.
- Go.
- Right.
- So, BenWhy Calzone? - Glad you asked, Chris.
You know, there's fast food hamburgers.
There's fast food Mexican.
There's fast food Chinese.
Blah blah blah.
Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food? What about pizza? Pizza? Never heard of it.
That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris.
Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
Never thought of it that way.
What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container.
It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.
Amazing.
And you of all people will like this.
I'm gonna use low-fat ingredients.
Game-changer.
And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery "The Low-cal Calzone Zone.
" That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.
That idea is terrible.
Glen, you're killing me.
They broke about 50 laws, Knope.
And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me.
Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice home-cooked meal, and do what comes naturally.
That's not appropriate.
You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.
I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team.
- I need them, please.
- Fine.
But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck.
It would just mean so much to us.
I mean, you're a living legend.
They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.
Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a double-edged sword.
Everybody in this town still calls me "Pistol.
" Tell me more about that, Peter.
I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you.
Hey, man, you want to go for a jog? Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going? Oh, no, thanks, Chris.
Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.
You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here.
I think getting some perspective would be good.
What are you talking about? I've known you a long time.
And, right now, you need help.
- With my Claymaish? - With your life.
You are wildly, insanely depressed.
Depressed? I'm the furthest thing from depressed.
I mean, look at what I've accomplished.
Do you see him? Do you think a depressed person could make this? No.
- That's all we can fit in here.
- No problem.
This is going to be fine.
We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do.
Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom.
- Oh! He shall do it in the car! - Answer your phone, Ann.
That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.
Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline.
I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around.
I'm not faffing around.
I've sunk myself into my hobbies.
Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay? Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, andI think it's really good.
So just hang on to your hat, okay? Here it goes.
Oh, how great.
Stand in the place where you-- - Did you pause it? - No, I--hang on.
Stand in the place where you-- Oh, my God.
That's the whole thing.
- That's three weeks of work.
- You're gonna be okay.
No, no, no, no, I'm not.
You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool.
I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer? Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame.
Okay, no word from Ann.
April, I need a status report.
- How's it looking out there? - Perfect, but just one thing.
It's not a basketball court any more.
It's an ice skating rink.
Wait, what? Why? What happened? The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.
Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him.
Ron, how's the stage coming? Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it.
Oh, my God.
Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face? We had to "Jetsons" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house.
Wow.
- Okay, I got Pistol Pete.
- Good, where is he? Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work.
I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation.
Anyway, the important news is that he's here.
Good.
Is he going to dunk for me? I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying.
- He's crying? - No, I was crying.
It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life.
Oh, my God.
We should cancel it, right? Maybe we should cancel it? - Yeah.
- Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.
Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here.
Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term.
But for the record, I came through.
There are almost a hundred people out there! Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you? Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry? I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem.
Okay, guys, everybody listen up.
I just wanted to say thank you.
You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it.
Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can.
You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar.
That would be Hurley's.
- Oh, it's karaoke tonight! - Yes! No, no, no, guys.
No.
We're not leaving, okay? We're the reason Leslie's in this mess.
It's our mess.
We're going to stay here and we're going to go out there as a team.
Or, we go as a team to Hurley's.
No, Ann's right.
We're a team.
We're all going out together.
Let's give this crowd a show.
Go, team! Get up and make it happen get on your feet Tom? Couldn't afford enough premium carpet to get us to the stage.
I mean, it was a short walk, but it was pretty luxurious, right? Okay.
Everybody smile and wave.
Get up and make it happen get on your feet Stop leaning on my arm, Andy.
I'm holding the dog.
He is peeing.
He is now peeing.
I am putting him down.
No, Ron, he only has three legs! - Get off me! - No, I'm scared! Get up and make it happen Ron? Ron? There's no stairs.
How do I get onto the stage? Oh! And take some action Get on your feet get up and make it happen get on your feet Okay.
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Get on your feet Mm-mm.
Here you go.
Drink up, because it has every herb in my herb belt.
Oh.
Tastes like a belt.
I know, isn't it awful? But it works wonderfully.
So, tell me.
Do you admit that you're depressed? How did you know? I didn't even know.
The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun.
You can't hide these things from friends.
I think I'm feeling better.
Herbal smoothie, you have done it again.
As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry.
My cards got out of order here when they fell.
Together, we can defeat obese children.
I'm sure that was something positive, originally.
I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it? This is the worst political event ever in history.
Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting.
It sure will be! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete, and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend! I just wanted to say that I fully endorse Leslie Knope.
She's got a great team behind her, and a vote for her is a slam dunk.
Thanks, Pistol Pete! Wow, we're so happy to have you.
Oh, hey.
There he goes.
Come on, Pete! Oh! Okay, stay still.
Stay down.
Pistol Pete, everybody.
Still got it.
- Hey.
- Hey, how was the rally? - Oh, we nailed it! - No, we didn't.
Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision.
We've decided to fire the campaign manager--me.
- And hire you.
- But we've talked about this.
I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.
This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.
You're the only one that can save us.
Please be my campaign manager.
You know, Leslie, Ben's really been going through something, and he's on a journey, so I don't think he's gonna be-- I'll do it.
I'm in.
I've done enough exploring.
I'm good.
- Okay, great.
- Ann, you're fired.
Oh, thank God.
No, don't make out.
It's making Champion sad.
Surprise! We felt really bad about the whole dredging up your past just to be publically humiliated thing.
- So, cookies.
- And balloons.
Thanks, guys.
It-- that's nice.
We feel so bad.
Is there anything else we can do? You could let me take you to dinner.
Yes, Ann, yes.
You should do that.
Oh, I can't, though, because I'm married.
You're not married.
She's not married.
This is uncomfortable.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next city councilor for the great city of Pawnee Bobby Newport.
Hey.
Thanks, guy.
Hey, all right.
Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.
You know, we're two days into this campaign, and so far it's going great.
In fact, I don't know why they call it a "cam-pain.
" Because up until now it's been a "cam-pleasure.
" All right, hey, why don't we line up for autographs and free Bobby bars.
Huh? Who wants a Bobby bar? Bobby Newport, heir to the sweetums candy fortune.
My dad made 'em.
He just entered the race, and he's already He is attractive and charming.
And his family employs half the town, but so what? I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's well-versed in the issues.
And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.
How's it going? I'm Bobby Newport.
But you probably knew that already.
Well, Mr.
Newport, we meet at last.
I'm Leslie Knope.
Ah, okeydoke.
So do you want me to sign that to miss lope or just Nesney? What? No.
Leslie's fine.
Leslie? Yeah, miss Knope is a candidate for city council.
Been calling your office trying to set up a debate.
Oh, no, you guys are wrong.
I'm running unopposed.
I'm pretty sure I'm running unopposed, right? No, you're not running unopposed.
You've very opposed by me.
Oh, terrific.
I love meeting people.
I love it, yeah.
What do you guys do? We just told you.
We're gonna be running for city council.
Great.
Here, have a Bobby bar.
Go ahead, my dad made 'em.
Okay, folks.
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.
I think we scared him.
Here, have a Bobby bar.
My dad made 'em.
Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse or did they fire you because you slept with all the doctors? You wanna try that again? Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse? Because Andy's not feeling well.
What's wrong, Andy? Just got a headache.
And I'm seeing double.
And I got a song stuck in my head, and my teeth hurt.
Also I'm hungry.
Okay, well, some of those things are symptoms and some of them are just being a person.
Did you hit your head? No.
Oh, yes, technically I did smash my head area into the wall area.
Yeah, he was hanging up his gold record.
Oh, my God, are you okay? Yeah, I'm good.
Point is, I have a gold record.
Well, I can help you with cuts and bruises but the other stuff you're gonna have to see a real doctor.
Hey, smart ass, we can't afford it.
Hey, smart ass, yes, you can.
You have insurance.
Neither of your asses are that smart because insurance is for if something bad happens to your car.
P.
S.
I haven't had it in years.
Oh, my God, we used to live together.
Yeah, you still got it for me.
I'm Bobby Newport.
My family owns nine square Miles of land in this town.
And isn't my family what this town's really about? Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
That guy is everywhere.
I am not complaining.
Well, we have to find a way to beat him.
And luckily Ben is going to announce the most amazing campaign strategy ever thought of in the entire history of western democracy.
Go, Ben, here's your great idea.
We're all ready for it.
And start.
I'm running for office.
I'm surrounded by my friends.
My campaign manager and I are in love.
This is exactly how I dreamed it would be when I was a kid.
Except I wasn't and my campaign manager was Mr.
belvedere.
We are David.
Newport is goliath.
This is our slingshot.
- Yes, we'll write an inspiring op-ed piece.
- No, the Pawnee-eagleton high school basketball game.
Now, in this town it's bigger than the super bowl.
We take all our money, we air a TV ad right at halftime.
And I think we should make an attack ad against Bobby Newport.
- Oh! - That is a great idea! - Thank you.
- Excellent.
- Yay, it's a good idea.
- All right, great.
So let's get to work.
Ron Swanson.
How are you? Present.
I have a meeting at public works, and I was thinking that maybe you might wanna sit in.
Why would you think that? They are working on a number of fascinating, big-budget projects I'm very busy here.
That I am being forced to brutally cut entirely.
I can make room in my schedule.
Wonderful.
As you know, I'm not a big fan of delivering bad news.
Chris, it would be my absolute pleasure.
Have you considered cutting the entire fire department? I've personally put out several local fires at no cost to the taxpayer.
Look to the left.
The right.
Whatever.
Are you the kind of doctor who gets hooked on his own drugs? I bet you are.
So, Andy, tell me what happened.
I was reading an encyclopedia, and I tripped or "fell over" and hit my head or brain helmet.
Yeah, he sneezed and smacked his head against the wall.
That sounds about right.
Well, if it's a concussion it's extremely mild, so I wouldn't worry about it.
Anything else bothering you? - Nope.
- Okay.
Well, I mean, yeah, I've got a weird rash in my knee pit area.
And my tongue, on this side, doesn't taste anything anymore.
Sometimes when I walk my ankles make, like, a weird rattlesnake sound.
What else? Things that are far away from my eyes are fuzzy.
I once at a twix with the wrapper on it, and I've never seen the wrapper come out.
Also I've swallowed every piece of gum that I've chewed for the past 25 years.
- Andy! - I don't know.
I broke my thumb on the way over here.
Just fix me.
Well, I can help you with the thumb.
And I'll have to give you referrals for specialists for the other thousand things.
Wow, thanks for nothing, Dr.
Harris.
You're welcome.
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.
I'm a regular guy.
I like dogs.
I'm here with my persian greyhound raclette, who was given to me by my buddy, the pretender to the crown of alsace-Lorraine.
Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Hey, um, between you and me, I think that Donna is having a problem with going negative in the ad.
- Nah-uh, I always go negative.
Even if I like the guy I go negative.
Keeps 'em interested.
Thanks, Donna.
Well, I didn't want to tell you this, but Ann is having a hard time with it.
She's kind of freaking out right now.
Oh, my God, this magic marker smells like cherries.
Hey, here's a question, do you like the idea? It's who Do you like it? Look, you have a vision of how your campaign should go.
I am your chief strategist, so I'm sure we can work it out.
Why don't you just tell me what you're thinking.
I hate negative ads, and I would never do one in a million years.
Thank you, John, for coming in.
The public works department is wonderful, and you are the best idea man in the business.
We're cancelling all of your ongoing projects.
What? What about the Pawnee river dam? Dam's dead.
Have a nice day.
Where will all the water go? Wherever it's headed now.
The important thing is the dam is never happening and your dream has been crushed.
- We're very sorry.
- I am not.
Good meeting.
It's not a negative ad.
We're stating facts about him, and, yeah, they happen to be negative because he's a bonehead.
Well, I wanted to run an ad that highlights the good things about me, not the bad things about somebody else.
Tom, you are our communications director.
Weigh in here.
Leslie, I love your idea.
I also love your idea.
Two great ideas, two great people.
I don't know which idea's better, but I do know I'll end up on the winning side.
When I bet on horses, I never lose.
Why? I bet on all the horses.
How 'bout we do this, we split up into teams, we each make a demo version of our ad.
Whichever one we like better we use.
Great idea! As long as Leslie thinks so as well.
Sure, I'll pick Ann and Donna for my team.
You can take Jerry.
What? Well, you wanted to go negative.
You got the biggest negative in the world, buddy.
Okay everybody I need big smiles from you We're making a positive ad here.
So just think of this as Christmas and your birthday and the first day of school all rolled up into one.
Positive is always better than negative.
Barack Obama said, "yes we can," and now he's president.
Ben says, "no we shouldn't," and now he's working for his girlfriend.
Guys, I need double the smiles, okay? Let's take it back again.
And action.
And this is going great.
We're really positive.
I think we're getting good stuff, right? What's it? Oh, come on.
Leslie, I think Bobby Newport's bus was in that shot.
Do you think? E, h, 4, m.
Potato shape.
Coffee mug shape.
Smudge, smudge, middle finger, smudge.
The rest are all smudges.
Oh, my God, you drove us here.
We made, like, 100 million doctors' appointments for ourselves in one week.
After this we won't have to go to the doctor for, like, ten years, because we're smart.
Well, you definitely need glasses.
No, he's not getting glasses.
I like his face the way it is.
If you get glasses, I'll divorce you.
Well, you heard her, doc.
Too handsome for glasses, no offense.
I gotta admit, his hair game's on point.
Gotta find out what kind of product he puts up in his "herr.
" Hey, how's Leslie's ad going? It's very good.
But yours is also very good.
- You ready for the voice-over? Yeah.
Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
You gotta give it more attitude.
It's gotta scare people.
Bobby Newport Yeah, okay.
All right.
Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
- Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
- Bobby.
- Bobby.
Bobby.
Newport.
All right, now we're just wasting time, Jerry.
Ron Swanson! I want to thank you for being so ruthless and cruel in the meeting the other day.
You'll have to be more specific.
With the public works department about the dam.
Ah.
What do you say I take you to lunch and then we can talk about all the projects that you want to get accomplished.
That won't be necessary.
I don't have any projects.
I hate projects.
What a pill.
We should order.
And then we can talk shop.
What are you gonna have? I'm thinking something raw and cucumber-based.
A cucumber.
I don't know what happened.
I declined his invitation.
He started laughing.
And the next thing I knew, we were at lunch.
Did he drug me? Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.
My dad is friends with John cougar mellencamp.
That's pretty cool.
What is this guy running for, president of being on every channel all the time? Reminder, Leslie, we have less than an hour to get the ad to the station.
Ann, you're beautiful and you're organized.
So in order not to bias anyone, these are the two ads that Ben and I made.
I'm just gonna pick one randomly, and we'll play that one first.
Oh, yay, the awesome one.
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.
I'm pro-parks, pro-public safety, and I'm pro-clean water.
I'm also pro-environmental regulation, and I'm very, very pro-local propositions But most of all, I'm pro-Pawnee.
Here are some other things that I'm pro.
As you can see, I'm in favor of a lot of things, like hot dogs.
Right, Charlie? I'm Leslie Knope, and I approve this message.
Yes.
I love it.
Fantastic.
Do we even want to screen yours? Uh, yeah, that was awful.
What do you mean? Name one thing that was wrong with it.
Okay, you never even mentioned you were running for office.
You literally never said the words "city council.
" I did it's implied.
I didn't we can just put it in.
Okay.
Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.
Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.
His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him.
His 60-foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12.
Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten.
She has.
Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.
Don't.
I won't.
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.
I love it.
Now, people, this is an ad.
It's succinct, it's punchy.
It's mean.
It's depressing.
It's awful.
"I am Ben Wyatt, and I want to destroy Leslie's dreams.
" Okay, if you're allergic to any food, we'll know in a few days.
I think based on the redness I might be allergic to getting stabbed by needles.
We have already been to, like, five different doctors.
I got my ankles microwaved.
- X-rayed.
They took my blood away to use for science.
Cholesterol tests.
April had her sinuses removed? Looked at.
Some guy looked at my wiener, touched it.
That was weird.
And that guy wasn't even a doctor.
That What? Now I think it is time for us to take a vote.
So who's in favor of Ben's ad? Traitors! Ann, I painted your garage pink.
I did not ask you to do that.
Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better.
Our friendship is over.
No, it's not.
It's not over.
It's never over.
Bff.
I love you forever.
You know what, it seems like we're kind of evenly split.
I think we should keep debating.
We're not split.
It's unanimous.
- We air my ad.
- But I This is just it's just not the way I dreamed it would be.
This is the right call, okay? I promise.
Okay.
I'm going to air a negative ad.
It's out of my hands now.
But you know what, I'm actually feeling very zen about this.
- Are you are Ben Wyatt? - Yeah.
Okay, I need that DVD in the control room.
- Aah! - Oh, my God.
I am Leslie Knope, and I do not approve this message.
What are you doing? What are you Ah.
Alright, the good news is, there's only two pieces of bad news.
The bad news is, none of our ads aired and we cannot get our money back.
Oh, God.
There was probably a better way for you to tell us that.
You both really blew this.
But I can't wait to hear your new ideas.
I love 'em already.
Ooh, I'm hungry.
Tommy needs a mango.
See ya.
I'm really sorry I tackled you.
It's just, I'd rather run the fake campaign ads that I made when I was ten than become negative and cynical.
Look, I really don't wanna crush your childhood dreams, but I bet in your dreams you weren't losing an election by 70 points.
You need to get tougher, Leslie.
You just have to.
You need to get tougher.
You were pretty easy to take down.
Thanks.
Ron Swanson! Just the man I wanted to see.
I'm going to be going to a seminar on the art of the japanese tea ceremony Or chakat the Pawnee community college, and I thought you might like to come with me.
Why? I know how much you value silence.
A fair point.
But we did just have lunch last week, so I feel like we've spent enough social time together for the foreseeableEver.
All right, well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Donna Meagle! Chris Traeger! For some godforsaken reason that man is suddenly determined to hang on with me.
You mean hang out? What is wrong with him? I don't know, he's got you doing Ben's job, eating lunch with him like Ben used to.
Maybe he just misses his little buddy.
Ow.
Let's get you home and get me some ice cream.
Here's your bill.
Whoa, yeah, won't be needing that.
I've got the free medicine card.
Uh, there's a $500 deductible for dental procedures.
Oh, I think you're wrong.
We have the insurance thing.
I believe we're covered.
It's still $500.
Let's see here.
Oh, because, you know what Let's go! Dine and dash.
Out of the way! Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Ah! Ah, call an ambulance! A different ambulance than the one I ran into.
This is city council candidate Leslie Knope when she was ten years old.
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.
I love Pawnee.
And I want to make it even better.
Better schools, safer streets, and a more progressive tax on residential properties.
This is city council candidate Bobby Newport today.
People keep asking me: Bobby, what are you gonna do once you get into office? Um, I'm pretty sure I'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope had better ideas when she was ten than Bobby Newport has now.
They do have one thing in common.
Both: I like dogs.
For a better Pawnee, vote Knope for city council.
Well, we already have a thousand views.
Yeah, but no calls from reporters, no interview requests.
I don't care.
I'm proud of it.
You sure? It is accurate about my opponent, it does not take Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold that thought.
Ron Swanson! What a pleasant surprise.
And who's this? This is a great friend of mine.
He is a fellow who works in the building and he is named Dennis.
Kyle.
He strongly enjoys japanese culture, and I thought he might wanna go with you to the thing.
- The tea ceremony.
- Yes.
You're a brother japanophile? I was eating rice, and Ron made me come up here.
But sure, that sounds fun.
Arigato.
Ron, a moment.
All right, pal, level with me.
What's going on? Well, you seemed like you wanted a friend.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not lonely.
I have me.
And 4,000 Facebook friends and a hot girlfriend.
I wanted to spend time with you, because I have to replace Ben as assistant city manager and I was giving you a tryout of sorts.
Now, I'll mull my options for the next few months, but I'd love you to keep an open mind.
Kyle-San! Arigato! Mr.
Newport, hello.
Hi.
Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt.
- Yeah, hi.
- Good to see you.
Nice to see you.
You guys want anything? This is a restaurant, so they have food and stuff.
- I'll take a milkshake.
- We're good.
No, we're good.
What can we do for you? Yes, um, why'd you guys post that video of me, man? I mean, that didn't make me feel good.
It was it was mean.
You guys are mean.
Well, we used your own ad, so I don't think it was mean.
All right, let me lay it out for you.
My friends keep sending me links to that video and they just make fun of me.
So just stop running, okay? Just that stop.
Stop running the ad? No, stop running the campaign.
What? Just quit.
It would be so cool of you if you just quit.
Then I can win the election, and I'll have a big party, and I'll put you both on the guest list, plus one.
I'm gonna have a man who does magic.
He's really good.
Not, like, cheesy magic.
Like, good magic.
We're not gonna quit the campaign.
Why would we do that? Because I want it.
Come on, give me it.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Come on, give me it.
Just give me the election.
I'm sorry, please.
Please.
Well, Leslie, he does make a compelling argument.
Come on, ugh! Come on, guy.
- Bobby.
- Ah, it's not padded! Can I ask you a question? Why are you even running for office? You know what, I need something to do to get my dad off my back.
This seemed easy.
What about you, why are you doing it? Who's your dad? I'm running for office because I want to improve the lives of the people that I love and the city that's the greatest city in the world.
What? What does that even mean? Hey, I've got an idea.
How 'bout you quit running, then I win, but then I let you do all the work.
I'm not going anywhere, and we are gonna debate soon, and I need to warn you, I know my stuff.
So you should toughen up.
Why are you guys smiling? I feel bad.
Hey, quick question.
That little girl from your video.
Oh, my God, she's so cute.
Do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me? That girl is me as a ten-year-old.
How'd you do that? Maybe you should see one of the other doctors.
No.
No more doctors.
They're a bunch of scam artists.
They reel you in with the free stuff.
Next thing you know, bam, you run into an ambulance.
Every time.
Let's just go home and care for each other.
We could buy a sewing kit.
You could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere.
Mmm, so romantic.
- - Oh, sorry, I forgot.
Let's go.
All right.
Do you think sewing kits are covered by insurance? Or groceries or, like, Xbox games? What is insurance? I don't know.
Who cares? 
I will institute a reduction in taxes For the small-business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business-related development.
Together we will build a better pawnee.
So what we're looking for here are your overall impressions of this candidate.
What do you like about her? What don't you like about her? Her ideas, her voice, her clothes probably.
Well, my campaign has a little momentum, so we're trying to capitalize on that by doing a focus group.
Some things are very helpful.
Other things are not so helpful.
All the things make me feel a lot of feelings about myself.
She's kinda short, don't you think? Aggressively short almost.
It's like she's throwing it in my face.
Insightful.
You, sir, said you would not vote for her, correct? Yeah.
Yeah, she seems a little uptight.
She doesn't seem like the kind of person you could go bowling with, you know? What? That's ridiculous.
I am excellent at bowling.
Ask Ron.
Leslie, I know it's tough to hear these things, but just try not to get obsessed over one comment.
You're totally right.
I'm not obsessing.
Okay, what are you doing? I'm just reminding myself to tell Ron to tell you how good I am at bowling.
All right.
I actually thought that she was smart, and I'd vote for her.
There you go.
Although I once knew a Leslie, and, uh, she was just awful.
So now I hate all Leslies.
Would she consider changing her name? Okay, here we go.
a strong command of the issues.
That is good, but only 33% said that they would consider voting for you.
Mm, yeah, that's really interesting stuff.
Why did that guy say that he wouldn't want to go bowling with me? You really have to let that go.
I've never been very good at letting things go.
I can't tell you how many times a fun tug-of-war with a dog over a chew toy turned contentious.
One of us always ends up mad.
I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek.
Oh, my God.
And get this he's not even that good of a bowler.
His average is 132, according to the most recent available data.
Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you're good at bowling - which I am.
Ask Ron.
- Which we all know you are.
But some people have the impression that you're a little elitist or intellectual or something.
That is so sexist.
It's just because I'm a woman.
Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about.
See, a lot of people don't vote with their brains.
They vote with their guts.
I know you're fun, and you can have a good time.
The public needs to see that.
Well, then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night.
- Hmm.
- It would be laid-back.
Everyone having fun, great photo op.
That could actually work.
Also I'm really good at bowling.
No, I don't think I believe you.
Is there anyone I can ask? Yeah.
Ask Ron.
Oh, okay.
You're kidding.
All right, it is time for the 12th Leslie Knope Fundraising Phone Bank.
Is everybody feeling good? Oh, I don't know, Jerry.
It's Sunday night, I'm making phone calls to strangers, and you're in my house.
My life couldn't be worse.
Hey! Let's get this phone party started.
- No.
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
I know this kind of thing can be a grind, but Ben said that this is the most important thing we can do to help Leslie.
So tonight is going to be fun.
You're probably thinking, how could it possibly be fun? - No one's thinking that.
- I kinda was.
I was not.
Why are we laughing? Well, anyway, tonight we are gonna spice things up with a little competition.
Whoever raises the most money by the end of the night will win two free movie passes to the pawnee mono-plex.
You really think that's gonna motivate people oh, my God.
I could use that for a romantic night with Millicent Gergich.
Out of my way, suckers.
As city manager, I play no favorites.
But as a private citizen, I am free to support whomever I choose, and I choose to support team Knope 'cause they're the best.
Everybody's the best.
We're all winners.
- Do I look laid-back? - You look like you're trying to look laid-back.
How about now? I think just maybe just stand how you would normally stand.
Okay.
I forget now.
Hey, Ron.
Thanks for coming, man.
Of course.
This bowling alley has my favorite restaurant in pawnee.
Really? You're not scared to eat here? When I eat, it is the food that is scared.
Why are you sitting weird? - Damn it.
- Who's ready to bowl so hard? Tommy's new bowling swag.
You know what? When you do it, you really do it.
Good for you, man.
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Leslie Knope, who is running for city council.
Is this Deirdre Splatterfork? That is literally the most beautiful name I have ever heard.
No, I don't think we can accept donations over $50.
I don't really know why you would need my social security number, but well, yeah, no.
You're right.
I guess it couldn't hurt to give it to you.
It's 210 absolutely nothing.
What are you wearing? Fine, if you don't wanna donate, then don't.
Oh, by the way I'm calling from inside your house.
- Ha ha! $100.
- Whoa.
This is unbelievable.
I cannot be stopped.
I don't care about that prize, but I'm gonna win because I want his happiness to go away.
Type in "T Rex" for me.
No, no, no.
Um, "t-boz.
" Wait, wait.
"Tommy Tsunami.
" No, "ticky ticky Tom-Tom.
" No, "fly guy.
" I wrote "tom.
" Classic.
Timeless.
I love it.
"Girl"? I saw your ad from when you were a kid, but it's nice to have a beer and get to know you.
Aw, thanks, rich.
Oh, here.
Smile.
Maybe you'll get your picture the pawnee journal.
Hey, this is going really well.
Pretty decent turnout.
Yeah, you know, I feel very, you know, casual, relaxed.
Hey, is that the guy from the from the focus group? Huh.
I don't know.
- I think it is.
- Is it? Excuse me, sir, would you mind telling me how you heard about the event tonight? Oh, uh, I got a weird invitation in the mail.
I didn't realize we were sending out invitations.
Oh.
Hey, you're that girl from the focus group thing I did.
Oh, I wouldn't know.
I'm never on the other side of the glass with those things.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Yep.
Straight down the middle.
No hook, no spin, no fuss.
Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
Come on, big girl.
Let's knock these little pins down.
Oh, my God, are you serious? Son, people can see you.
Boom! That right there Tommy's strike.
Leslie, what happened to the big picture? I'm thinking about the big picture.
I'm trying to make the picture bigger by including this guy in it.
I can't do anything about my gender or my height, but I can win that guy over with a fun round of bowling.
We need everyone here to see a different side of Leslie Knope, not one specific person.
Some people just aren't gonna like you.
Let it go.
Okay, I hear you.
I'll treat him just like everybody else.
I'll just say hi to him, shake his hand, buy a him a few beers, share a few laughs, bowl a few frames, lose intentionally to make him feel good, friend him on Facebook.
And by the end of the night, he will be mine.
Whoa, "thar" she bowls.
I'm Leslie Knope.
You wanna bowl? You wanna bowl together? You wanna be, like, bowl buddies? Sure.
Great, just a casual game, you know? No biggie.
You okay? My sister has scoliosis, and I think you might, you know Oh, no.
No, I'm just I'm just being cas.
What are you rocking? A 15 pounder? - 16.
- Whoa, hey, good for you.
Oh, there they are.
I just ordered some wings for us.
You like wings? - Love them.
- Really? Who knew? I knew.
Damn it.
Why are you mad? You bowled a strike.
That's how I motivate myself, you know? Never good enough.
Let me get you a beer.
Cool.
These beers are as cold as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.
You watch Ice Road Truckers? Yeah, dude.
It's my guilty pleasure.
Tom, I'm asking you as a man to stop this immediately.
- Boom! - What the? Hello, is this Mrs.
Gallivan? Well, my name is April, and wouldn't you know it, I'm raising money for a city council candidate I believe in.
No, mira, mira, mira, mira, mira.
It's, like, whatever you want.
Like, $10.
It don't matter.
Well, I reckon it's just like grammy Martha told me and my cousins, "you can't eat the biscuits if you don't pay for the flour.
" Put the phone down, take a deep breath, and then you are going to tell Steven that you will be treated with respect, okay? And thank you for your donation.
Well, gee, I don't know, Fred.
All I know is that I just want to live in a world that's a better place, and your contribution will definitely help us get there, to the Better-place world, Fred.
Yeehaw! Man, move over, pins.
There's a new Sheriff in town.
You are so down with strikes, they should call you Norma Rae.
- Who's that? - It's a Sally Field movie about Unions.
Doesn't matter.
The point is, you're really good at this.
It's your turn.
Try not to break a nail.
Ah, classic Derek with the Zings.
Man, that's what bowling is all about hey.
How's it going? - It's going really good.
- Oh, good.
Um, we're just hanging out and having a very good time.
Okay, I just wanted to remind you that when you're bowling, try not to fixate on just one pin.
You're trying to knock down a lot of pins.
I realize that, but I will knock down this pin, and then this pin will knock down all the other pins.
- Really? - Mm-hmm.
Hey, could you get me another one of these? I I don't work here.
Classic Derek.
I am taking a probiotic tea break.
And while that is happening, I thought I might share some big news.
I am going to ask Millicent Gergich to move in with me.
D-I I mean, if that's okay with you of course, Jerry.
- Uh, yeah.
- Of course.
Sure.
That's awesome, man.
Hey, do you guys wanna live here with us and Ben and champion, the three-legged dog? - That is an amazing offer.
- Yes! But I think we're probably gonna get our own place.
I'm already working with a Real Estate agent to find an octagonal house.
I've done some reading, and an octagon is the optimal shape for a home in terms of energy flow.
You know, Chris, I hate to pull rank, but if you're going to take a break, would you mind going in the living room, just, you know, so it doesn't disturb everybody else.
Jerry, I love it when you pull rank.
You're being weird.
Why? Milli's gonna break up with Chris.
Shut up.
Oh, my God, that's gonna super weird when they move in together.
Yeah, I don't know when, but she is definitely gonna do it.
Nice.
Hey, Ron.
Were you trying to get a seven? Because if you were, you did a great job.
I am very angry right now.
What? My finger was in there.
Ron crushed my finger.
I think it might be broken.
- Are you a female bird? - It was an accident.
Oh, my God, it's already swollen.
Tom, my God, do you have any pride at all? You did this on purpose.
You're jealous of my gift.
Okay, come on, Tweety Bird, let's get you some ice.
- It hurts.
- Come on.
Well, congratulations, man.
Fun match, fun game, good times.
Did you have fun? Yeah.
I'm not one to complain about free beer and free bowling.
See you around.
Okay.
Uh, just one second.
I'm running for city council, as you know, and uh, just wondering, do I have your vote? - No.
- Derek.
You old so-and-so.
For reals, can I count on your vote? Yeah, no, um, I don't think so.
But we've been here bowling all night, and we've been having fun.
And you're still not gonna vote for me? Why? - I don't like you, okay? - Leslie, Leslie.
Well, you're a crappy bowler, and I pretended to lose to you.
Yeah, right.
I destroyed you.
No, it's true.
I am a really good bowler.
Ask Ron.
I don't know who Ron is.
But if you're so great, let's play again.
Good.
I'd love to.
Tell you what, if I win, I get your vote.
If I win, you clean my house for a month.
- Done.
- Hey, Leslie.
I'd like to introduce you to my good friend, anyone else.
Not now, Ben.
I'd like to introduce Derek's ass to my foot.
Get me another beer.
I don't work here.
$20? Thank you.
Uh, you know, we're really looking for donations more in the $10,000 range.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.
Just one second.
Let me get off this call.
Hi, I'm so sorry.
I'm back.
What, champion? You need to go outside now? Come on.
That a boy.
Sorry, he's hates awkward situations.
Oh! - Terrible moonwalk.
- Don't care.
Yeah, what's up now, huh? Aw, you got a spare.
That's so cute.
Check out the scoreboard.
So Millicent and I are going to take a nice little stroll, and I'll be back soon.
You know, if you want to take the rest of the night off, you know, that would be fine.
Well, I don't think that will be necessary.
Unless you also want to go get dinner.
Nope, this won't take too long.
Chris, you might want to take a jacket with you.
It's about to get cold out there.
Thanks, Donna, but Millicent's company will keep me warm.
Take the jacket.
I wished for his happiness to go away.
I might be a wizard.
Hey, Derek.
What a defeat, man.
I mean, I did not expect to win by that much.
But I warned you, I am a good bowler.
- Whatever.
- All joking aside, I wanna say that I actually had fun.
And I'm really looking forward to your vote in the spring.
Yeah, I'll just write in "bitch.
" I'm sorry, what did you just say? Just ignore him.
He's being a jerk.
I said she's a bitch.
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell? I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
That was awesome.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, look.
Here's that photo op you wanted.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
So you know that's everything that happens so it was just what happened.
It was just like - What's wrong with you? - I don't know, I just I have a lot of adrenaline right now.
Just take a few deep breaths, okay? The guy said he might press charges.
Yeah, well, Randy, I would like you to know that we will not be pressing charges.
Yeah, that really wasn't an option.
Come on, the guy was being a total jerk.
What Ben did was warranted and extremely awesome, by the way.
Did you write down how awesome it was? When we write official reports, we refrain from using words like "jerk" or "awesome.
" - Hey, here you go.
- Hey.
Wow, you and me, huh? Hurt "fingies.
" No, no, two totally different injuries.
Okay, you just hang in there, okay? Okay, love you too.
Bye-bye.
Well, that was Milli.
It happened.
She broke up with Chris.
- Boo.
- Damn you, Jerry.
It's not my fault.
Well, I feel sorry for the man.
Well, anyway, the fundraising challenge is over, and the winner whoa.
We have a surprise winner, April.
April wins two tickets to the pawnee mono-plex.
- Yes.
- That's my wife.
Okay, everything's settled here.
Wanna head home? No.
We haven't finished yet.
Last frame, your turn.
- He hurt his hand.
- Last frame, go.
- Fine, I'll bowl one-handed, like an idiot.
Whoo! Oh, come on.
King Kong ain't got nothing on me.
Ow, my "fingie" still hurts.
Oh, the bravery.
The perseverance.
You're an American hero.
And the best part is, beautiful, you get to drive the champion home.
Well, the headline I would've gone with is "no-strike-bowling bowler struck by Knope's striking beau.
" Okay, one more time.
Let me resign.
It's the only thing that truly protects you.
- Non-starter.
- Okay.
- Now when you take questions, I think you should be brief and sincere.
Don't try to justify what I did.
Just apologize again, and stay on script.
Are you sure that you don't need more whipped cream? Not today.
I don't deserve it.
I got us into this mess because I was fixating on that guy.
But this is ridiculous.
I do need more whipped cream.
Ma'am.
Hi.
April Ludgate.
How are you doing? Uh, whatever.
I'm fine.
Um, how are you? Well, as you may know, Millicent Gergich ended our relationship last night, which was disappointing.
But here's why it may be the greatest thing that ever happened.
Yeah, good point.
Hadn't thought about it that way.
Um, here.
Take these tickets.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Y-you earned them.
They're movie tickets, Chris.
They're, like, 8 bucks.
It's a gesture.
There are three of them.
I thought there were only two.
Yeah, I know, I bought another one because I thought that maybe you, me, and Andy could go to the movies sometime.
Just take the stupid tickets.
I'm just trying to be nice.
- Thank you.
- There you go.
Okay, bye.
Leslie, are you going to fire Ben Wyatt? Are you going to suspend your campaign? I'd like to first start by saying thank you for coming.
And on behalf of Ben Wyatt and everyone involved in my campaign, I'm very sorry for what happened at the rock n' roll bowling alley last night.
You know what? No, I'm not.
- I - I'm not sorry.
This guy was drunk, and he was aggressive.
And he was rude, and he was foul-mouthed.
And he called me by my second least favorite term for a woman, and my campaign manager punched him.
I do not condone violence, but I have to be honest, it was awesome.
And my campaign manager and I made out a lot afterward.
Ah, I probably shouldn't have said that.
But that's what happened.
Derek hates me, and I don't particularly like him.
So what's the point, right, Derek? I feel like you're being kind of a bitch right now.
See? So I'm not going to apologize.
And if people won't vote for me because of that, well, there's nothing I can do about it.
But you should be warned.
If you do not vote for me, my boyfriend might beat you up.
Now if anyone has any questions about the issues facing our city, I'm right here.
Okay, what are your overall impressions of this woman? What do you like about her? What don't you like about her? - I like her.
- What do you like about her specifically? I don't know.
She's tough, I guess.
I just like her.
I like that that one guy punched that other guy, and then I like that she stood by him.
See? People vote with their gut.
Yeah, that guy said he didn't like my earrings.
Go punch him.
Sure.
Here you go.
Lane eight.
No, Lane 22.
The one at the very end.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, perfect game.
What's your name? Put it up on a wall.
I was never here, and you will never speak of this again 
Okay, time for gifts.
We have gift certificates for facials everybody, then you're gonna get a needlepoint pillow with your face on it and a news headline from a newspaper on the day you were born.
"Joseph Stalin dies"? That's right, Mom, and you replaced him.
Though not in terms of genocide.
Just in terms of, you know, being on earth.
February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance, but February 13th, galentine's day, is about celebrating lady friends.
It's wonderful, and it should be a national holiday.
It should be a national holiday.
Dear Congress, it's Leslie again.
Let's talk about personal relationships.
Who wants to start? Donna? I have several men in rotation.
One's waiting for me out in the car.
Don't worry, I rolled down the window.
April, you're the old married broad here.
- How's Andy? - Well Last week he was supposed to buy gas, but instead he bought novelty cookie cutters.
Now everything we eat is shaped like a dinosaur.
He's amazing.
Great.
And mom, how's it going with Steven? Well, I met him on the Internet because of my lovely daughter, and we are compatible.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
Ann, can you start talking? Well, I'm--I'm--I'm in a bit of a lull right now, but I'm so glad that you all have people in your lives that you care about, so Congrats! It's really hard to say congrats without sounding sarcastic.
Seriously, I really hope you guys are all very happy-- - Damn it.
- We are.
Ann, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I put you on the spot when I asked you about your love life.
How are you doing? You know, I'm mostly fine being single.
It's just this time of year with the hearts and roses, it just gets me a little down.
But galentine's day made me feel better, so thanks.
Oh, Ann, you beautiful spinster.
I will find you love.
What? Did you say something? Love you.
Thank you all for being here.
Let's get started.
Wow.
Great attitude, Ron.
Sorry, I was talking to these ribs.
Okay, so the Valentine's Day dance is planned, prepped, and under budget, but we have one final task.
Ann Perkins is currently attending the Valentine's Day dance alone, so I need each one of you to bring an eligible bachelor for her tomorrow.
Ann's not totally hideous.
Why does she need our help? Because that's what friends do, April.
They help friends find happiness.
Now the last guy she liked was Chris, but she can't date him again because he's her boss.
So when we're thinking of prospective sweethearts, we need to think of people who are Attractive and smart and kind.
And if you're wondering what kind of guy is right for Ann, all you need to do is ask.
Also you need to find someone educated, and friendly, and fun-- - just tell us the damn word.
Effervescent, he needs to be effervescent.
Quick question about Ann-- does anyone know if she has any indian in her? No one respond.
- No one say anything.
- Why? I'm just curious if Ann - has a little indian in her.
- Silence.
- I don't think she does.
- Would she like some? Jerry! Happy Valentine's Day.
- AndOoh-ah! - Yachter Otter? - Yup.
Two months ago, I have a dream about a playboy otter lost at sea, and you make him real? - Uh-huh.
- I love it.
I thought we had agreed that we weren't gonna get each other presents 'cause we were too busy with the campaign-- I got you something too.
Oh, a bomb? It is a cryptex, like in that movie The Da Vinci Code, which was the first movie that you and I ever watched - on Starz HD.
- Wow, that's specific.
Inside it will tell you where to meet me at 9:00 P.
M.
tonight, and the combination is a five-letter code that captures the essence of our third date.
- Yeah - So I will see you tonight.
UnlessYou can't crack the code.
I think I can crack the code.
I have no idea what the code is.
Hey, man, you okay? Still thinking about your ex? Millicent Gergich has literally torn my heart from my body and replaced it with a thick slab of sadness.
I may never smile again.
Cool, so I found a DJ for the dance, and his name is DJ Bluntz.
Tom, this is a publicly funded couples dance.
I don't think it's appropriate for people to be getting "wet with sound.
" Who's gonna do it, then? I will.
I certainly have no other plans for Valentine's Day, because I am completely alone.
All right, I'll see you later, Chris.
Aw, cool cryptex, can I have it? Hey, no.
No, you can't-- Where'd you get it? How do you know what a cryptex is? I know what things are.
Well, Leslie hid the location of our Valentine's meeting place - in here.
- No.
I tried every five-letter word that has anything to do with our third date.
Have you tried [Bleep]? That's a four-letter word.
Oh.
Add an "s"? I really don't think it's that.
Uh, I wish I could help you, bro, I don't know if I can.
You're, like, the second smartest guy I know.
You should go to the first smartest guy I know.
Okay, so the clue is inside, but it takes a five-letter code to open it-- Andy! Did you try [Bleep]? Ha! Yes, why is that everyone's first suggestion? Just smart people.
I think I might be able to help you.
Told you.
- Let me see it! - Yeah, you're gonna see it.
I'll show you.
I can unroll it.
"The murals with this heart you see, look to the first, and there your next clue will be.
" The first letter of the name of each mural with a heart on it will spell out the clue.
Or some-- or something.
Let's check out the murals.
Happy Valentine's Day, Pawnee.
For me, it is not happy.
But don't let my sadness diminish your night.
Anyway, life is fleeting.
Leslie.
Found a date for Ann.
Jerry, well done.
I put an ad on Craigslist: "Man seeking man for a night of casual fun.
" Enrico, he responded right away.
- I'll meet you inside, okay? - Okay.
You hired a male escort.
A what? Please get your gigolo out of here.
I-- uh-- oh, my God.
Okay, so we've got all the ones from this side with the heart sticker.
All right, the ones from the other hallway are "Cornfield Slaughter," "Lament of the Buffalo," "Needless Slaughter," "Slaughter Gone Wrong," "Eating the Reverend," "It's Raining Blood," - and "Death Everywhere.
" - Great.
I got it from here.
Thanks, guys.
I hope I didn't screw up your Valentine's Day too much.
Oh, God, no.
April hates Valentine's Day.
And brunch.
And outside.
And smiling.
- She's weird.
- Wait.
I figured it out.
The letters unscrambled say, "No food finer.
Clue three at J.
J.
's Diner.
" How many clues are there, exactly? Hey, you're here.
And I brought a bachelor.
- Are you kidding me? - No.
You brought Orin? Ann is not some weird, morose mummy.
Offense intended, Orin.
Let this be a wake-up call about the way you present yourself to the world.
I think Ann and him would be cute together.
I ask you to do one thing.
Do you know how hard I've been working to try to pull this together before Ann gets here? - Hey.
- Hey, you're here.
We weren't talking about you.
- How are you? - Well It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single, and I'm at a couples dance.
I can't imagine a more depressing place to be.
What about a wedding where you used to go out with the groom, and you're the only one there without a date, so the bride makes you dance to Single Ladies by yourself? Oh, my God, did that happen to you? Maybe.
Let's get a drink, and then you and I are gonna have some f-u-n.
Well, at least the music seems about right.
There was supposed to be, like, 20 guys here for Ann, and there's only four.
Who else do we have? Ben, taken.
Jerry, taken.
Oh! My dentist Is 80, and he's gay, and he's taken.
Uh what's this? P.
Hut? Oh, Pizza Hut! Hold on Hi, how cute are you? Ann, this is my lawyer friend, Alex.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you - In the last hour.
- Yeah.
Well, Alex gives my campaign legal advice, and Ann is the greatest human being ever invented.
So I'm gonna-- what? Uh, someone needs me.
I'm gonna go, and you two just hit it off now.
- You crazy kids.
- Okay Okay"There is no food finer.
" For Leslie, that means whipped cream, or No, it's whipped cream.
I'm gonna look in the whipped cream cans.
Oh, got some! Oh Nothing yet.
Okay, "something wicked this way comes," "whence you peruse a book with your thumbs.
"Go to the one who succumbs.
I'll be attached with a little gum.
" Oh, come on, Leslie, gimme a break.
I hate riddles and other such nonsense, I want that on the record.
But something wicked with a book is my ex-wife, from the library.
Which means I'm the one that succumbs.
Uh"I'll be attached with a little gum.
" Good God.
That woman is good.
"Follow me to the sheltered snow.
Only 22 clues left to go.
" Well, this is the woman I've chosen to love.
Well, I guess there's nothing to do but spend the entire night methodically solving this puzzle.
There's no way we'll finish in time.
Okay, I'll just make a list of places she and I have been together, and hope we luck out and find the last clue.
We'll split up, cover more ground.
Move.
Hey, Kriss Kross, can we change up the music? It kind of sounds like the end of a movie about a monk who killed himself.
- It is.
- Listen, man There's some attractive women here.
Why don't you rebound? Nobody here compares to Millicent.
Except maybe Jerry.
Technically they share 50% of the same DNA.
Stop staring at Jerry like that.
I don't know.
It's working now.
Hey, how's it going? It's Valentine's Day, and I'm working the late shift of the snow globe museum, so I'm right where I wanna be.
Okay, um, my girlfriend left a clue here, I think.
Like, for a scavenger hunt.
- Right.
You're Ben.
- Yes.
She said you'd be here by noon.
Not doing so good.
All right, well.
Thanks, Kevin.
I'm supposed to tell you that it's under one of the snow globes.
But which one? Ooh, I don't know.
Nope.
No.
No.
You really suck at this.
Okay, why don't you just Tell me where it is and I can get out of here? That would take all the fun out of it.
- Ah! - Winner.
Ah, ha, ha, ha.
I found it.
Yep.
Oh, wait.
No, that might be from another scavenger hunt.
Ann, looks like you already met Jeff.
Well, you didn't tell me that your friend was so beautiful.
Aww, thanks, Jeff.
Not as beautiful as my sister, but you know the law.
- What? - No, Jeff.
How am I supposed to find the love of Ann's life when it sounds like a funeral in here? There's no changing it as long as Chris is depressed.
I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
You go help Ann.
She's not responding to my top candidates, so we're gonna have to go with some wild cards.
- Got it.
- And April Thanks for nothing.
Why should I do anything to help her? Because despite the fact that all you do is give her a hard time, she would do this for you.
Just go hide under the table with your friend Orin.
Yeah, I see you, weirdo.
So Leslie dragged you into this sneaky little fix-up scheme, huh? We're stuck at a Parks and Rec community couples event.
What else you gotta do? What the hell.
You're right.
Bring 'em on, Tom.
I'm Harris.
Heard you were desperate for a man-piece.
We in business? He's 33 years old, still lives with his parents, and he's been to at least Try 308.
I'm gonna have to pass right now.
Your mistake, mama.
So, Bill, this stunning woman saves lives for a living.
What do you bring to the table? Uh, where to begin? Uh, I'm an amateur juggler-- Nope, you shouldn't have begun there.
Get out.
No one's trying to get with jugglers.
Thanks for playing.
Hello, my name is Ron Swanson.
I believe Leslie Knope may have left some kind of scavenger hunt clue here.
She did.
One second.
Gentlemen.
Ah-- .
Enjoy your evening.
Well it always says "Break glass in case of an emergency.
" Wait a second.
Well, there we go.
Hey, Chris, what do you think about changing the music? Sure.
Ugh.
Hey, you know what? You should look on the bright side.
I'm sure that Millicent couldn't keep up with you on your runs, so now you can go full speed again.
On the contrary, she was faster than I was.
I set many personal bests just trying to keep up with her.
Which is what I'm worried about.
What if she was my personal best? No, your best is still ahead of you.
I am 44 years old.
You don't look a day over 30.
Most people say 25.
- Who says that? - Lot of people.
You don't think that Millicent was my soul mate? There are a lot of soul mates in the world.
I mean, look at Ann.
You dated her, and she's a perfect human specimen, and you tossed her out like day-old chowder.
But it's gonna be okay.
Buck up.
Thanks, I'll try.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How is your evening unfolding in terms of your conversations with men? I have met a lot of different guys tonight.
How lucky that that happened to you - on Valentine's Day.
- What's lucky is that I have a best friend who spent her Valentine's Day trying to find me a date.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go home.
No.
Stay.
I just-- I'm gonna go home and watch TV.
Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and give me your car keys for a second? There's something I need to look at on your car keys.
You're gonna throw them on the roof again - so I can't leave.
- You know me too well.
You're the best.
It sucks being alone on Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna take Ann out for a drink, you know.
Try to cheer her up.
And I can be late meeting Ben.
He's not gonna be on time, 'cause those clues are hard.
They're really, really hard, and I'm really worried that he's not gonna be able to figure it out.
Ann, you tricky bastard.
- Leslie, what are you doing? - Look at Ann.
She's putting on makeup.
She using the emergency mini curling iron that I gave her.
- She has a date.
- You don't know that.
Why wouldn't she tell me who it is? Because she doesn't want me to know.
Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.
Wait, the music's better.
Have you seen Chris? I don't know, maybe he's in the bathroom or something.
She's going to meet Chris.
Hey, I got nine, three and four.
I have 11, 12, 13, 14, Whoa.
I got-- I got lucky.
And I love riddles.
Yo, found some clues.
Also found this.
Weird stick.
Might be a clue.
- No.
- Okay.
Did you find the 25th clue? No, I got #8, and #22.
What do you want, April? Leave Ann alone.
This is none of your business.
After all the hoops that Ben and I had to jump through because of the boss-employee thing, it is absolutely my business.
Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date.
I mean, so many injustices.
Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie.
You guys are such close friends, it's lame.
Just have a nice night with Ben, and forget about this.
Okay, fine.
I will let it go for now.
But I want you to know that I think there is some-- [beep] Okay, she hung up on me.
We failed.
If I just had a little more time.
She's waiting for me somewhere in Pawnee, - and I'm not gonna be there.
- Wait Leslie loves romance, but she also loves being right.
Is there something you used to disagree on, but you've since come around to her way of thinking? Ron, you're a genius.
Little Sebastian.
At first you did not understand what made this tiny horse so special, and now you love him more than I do.
Yep, I miss him every day.
I really tried to make that hard.
I'm very impressed with you.
Eh, some of them were kind of tough.
So are you ready to go have our first ever Valentine's dinner? Yes, but I have to tell you something.
Chris and Ann are on a secret date.
Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it.
And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner-- No, we have to go catch them in the act.
- Right now.
- Really? Yeah.
Screw romantic dinners.
Let's go rub it in their face.
God, I love you so much.
I cannot wait to see the look on Chris' remarkably youthful face when we march in there and confront him-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Leslie.
What? Ahh! Shh.
- Shh.
- April.
- Hey.
- April.
- Tom and Ann are on a date.
- I know.
What do you mean you know? How do you know? Because I set them up.
I was watching Ann with Tom at the dance and she seemed to be having a good time.
So I went over to talk to her.
What are you looking for in a date anyway? I don't know.
What does anyone want? Just a nice, funny guy who likes me and treats me well.
Tom's funny, and he'd treat you well.
- Ha, ha.
- I'm serious.
You want a good date, why not ask out the only guy that's made you smile tonight? He's ridiculous.
- All that dumb swagger.
- It's not.
He's sweet.
You should just ask him out for a drink.
I'm 1,000% sure he'd say yes.
I bet you guys would have a good time.
Man, I need to, like, wrap my head around this.
Why? It makes sense to me.
This is a small, loser town with loser people, and Tom's, like, at least semi-cool.
You know what I'm hearing? You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.
- Ugh.
- You're a very nice person.
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- Very nice person.
- Bye.
I do not understand this.
This really confuses me.
Well, you do love them both.
Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men.
Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.
You love Italian men? Not as much as Irish Scottish? White whatever you are.
This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.
So, Ann, it's finally happening.
Dude, this is so close to falling apart.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Can I be honest, though? I'm a little freaked out.
Like, I don't really understand what's going on.
This is what's going on-- we're gonna have a drink, and we're gonna talk, get to know each other.
And then I am going to drive home alone.
Cool.
Consider this alternate plan-- we have drinks here, get to know each other, whatever.
Then we go back to my place and snuggle up Like little bunnies.
- Yeah, this was a mistake.
- No! Leslie, thanks to your annoying prying last year, I'm sure you remember my birthday's coming up.
I know, I know.
No parties, you hate parties.
Correct.
Oh, you know that wild goose chase you sent Ben on for Valentine's Day? The scavenger hunt? - I also do not want that.
- Yep, I understand.
I absolutely do not want to solve a series of riddles and clues, each more intricate than the last.
You understand what I'm saying? - Yeah, I got it, Ron.
- Good.
Uh, I-I do want that.
Please do that for me.
- Oh, God.
- Hey, Boo-boo bear.
What did you just call me? - Boo-boo bear.
- Oh.
It's one of several nicknames I made up for you, and you can choose which one you like best, 'cause I want this to be a give and take.
Okay, we went out once, and nothing happened.
There is no "this.
" We have "cookie tush" Wow, just right out the gate.
"Winnie the boo," "Lady presh-presh," "Ann-Berry sauce," "Annie get your boo," "Tommy's girl," "Annie banannie--" Hey! All right, let's do this.
What are you doing? Is this not one of those? I might have misread the vibe.
Oh, my God, dude, you have to be cooler about this.
Look, I told Leslie because she's my best friend, but if anybody finds out about this and they start jabbering, it's gonna make it really hard to know if this is actually anything, so just keep it on the DL, okay? I feel like you're embarrassed by me.
That is accurate.
Can I at least change my Facebook status to "In a relationship"? Definitely not.
"It's complicated"? [Sighs] Whatever.
Am I in a relationship? It's complicated.
[Triumphant music] [Knock at door] Chief Trumple, nice to see you.
- Hi, - Hey, Knope.
Wyatt.
Been a long time, eh, cap'n? Or Captain.
"Oh, Captain, my Captain!" From Dead Poets' Society.
- You getting weird already? - Nope, I'm good.
Pawnee's police chief is retiring, and I'm trying to get his endorsement before he goes.
I'm really nervous because I need this for my campaign.
And Ben is really nervous because he is afraid of cops.
I'm not afraid of cops.
I have no reason to be.
I never break any laws, ever Because I'm deathly afraid of cops.
Look, Knope, I've always liked you.
But the Newports run this town.
And frankly, they've donated a lot of money to the department.
Mo' money, mo' problems, that's what I always say.
How about "mo' money, more protective kevlar vests" - that save lives"? - I-I Sometimes I say that, too.
I understand you need to think about it, but if you were going to make a decision-- The guys are throwing me a little retirement thing tonight at O'Flynnigans.
There's gonna be beer.
So why don't you swing by? I'll give you an answer.
Weirdo can come, too.
- All right.
- Let's go.
- Oh, hey, uh, may I say - Don't.
- That the boys in blue - Stop.
are heroes? Obviously some more than others.
Oh, boy, here it comes.
- And we're walking.
- Okay.
Listen up, people.
This is very serious.
Jerry, if you're eating, you're not listening.
Thanks, babe.
I don't know how many of you have heard, but there's a flesh-eating virus going around.
Yeah.
It's called "music," and there's only one way to get a vaccine, and that is to play it.
To play the-- you get an injection-- Just say your piece, son.
I have finished writing Leslie's campaign anthem.
It's called Catch Your Dream, and it's amazing.
It's kind of like We Are The World, except I actually think it could have a real impact on society.
Here's the thing--we need backup singers, and I thought, "who better to be backup singers than Leslie's campaign team?" Everyone's got something they're in charge of for Leslie's campaign.
My job is the song.
She originally put me in charge of hot dogs at this fund-raising barbecue, and I dropped them all-- all of them, like a thousand, so I really want to do a good job.
So we're gonna record this bitch tonight, Doubletime Studio.
Doubletime, you said? Little brick building over on Liondale Road? Yeah, you know the one? No.
You could not keep it together in there.
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm fine now, as long as we get out of here as quickly as possible and never come back.
Hey, Leslie! Oh! - Dave.
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
Wow.
- Hey.
You look great.
San Diego sun Got me all tanned up.
- So what are you-- oh, sorry.
Um, Ben, this, uh-- this is my-- this is Dave Sanderson.
- Oh, hey.
- Nice to meet you.
Uh, yes, uh, Leslie Knope is a female person with whom I was involved.
We had a romantic-- "romantical" involvement until I relocated to San Diego, which is-- that's in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles.
So we terminated our involvement at that time.
Are you here for a while? No, just tonight, for the chief's retirement thing.
Oh, yeah, we're going to that, too, actually, but we're gonna go a little later, 'cause first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice new French restaurant.
Cool.
I'm gonna go to the gas station and get a frozen burrito and eat it right there at that table.
Well, see you later.
You should come to dinner with us.
Okay.
I shouldn't have invited him.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no-- No, that's okay.
I mean, I just feel like it's kind of odd for me and him to hang out with you.
Honestly, if you want to just go out with him alone, I'd be totally okay with it.
No, look, he's here for one night.
He's a really great guy, and he's gonna love you, which--bonus--will make all the other cops love you.
Dave is a great person, and he's a great judge of character.
Tonight he's going to endorse Ben, and Trumple is going to endorse me.
Double endorsement.
Ooh, that sounds like an Ashley Judd movie.
Studio's down here.
Let's go.
Hustle, people, come on.
Jerry Ah.
That's vandalism.
I have a problem.
This happens to be the studio where a local saxophone legend named Duke Silver records his albums.
I've heard of him.
I heard he makes mature women swoon when he plays.
From what I've heard about Duke, he's kind of a private guy.
He doesn't want his nosy coworkers discussing his music with him or knowing that he exists.
So, if you happen to see any memorabilia laying around, kindly and discreetly discard it.
- You got it, Duke.
- Don't call me that.
I dig your groovy tunes, man.
Did you hear me? I said, "I dig your groovy tunes, man.
" Yo, Chuck, we're going to go ahead and play and sing at the same time.
I want this to have the electricity of a live concert.
So we have to play it perfectly every time? [Laughs] [Sarcastically] No, Burly, play it "unperfectly.
" You mean imperfectly? I mean perfectly.
- God, that was hot nonsense.
- Yeah.
Hey, uh, can I have a sip of that water? - Oh, sure.
- Thanks.
[Chuckles] That's sweet.
The two of you sharing a nice bottle of-- - You told them.
- [Scoffs] What? I asked you for one thing.
Fine.
I told them we went on a date.
- When? - As soon as I possibly could.
I texted them while we were on the date.
- [Sighs] - I'm sorry.
But you are too hot to hide, Ann.
This is on you.
Hey.
[Drumsticks tapping] When you two spoon, who spoons who? Ben's doing an amazing job as campaign manager.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
He's really smart.
You know, a campaign manager is only as good as the campaign person that he is managing.
So I'm trying to say you're a real smart lady.
Uh, you can say that again.
If anything, I'm holding her back.
Aw, Ben.
I said my thing first.
Actually, that's why we were at the police station today.
We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.
Oh, yeah? Hugh's a buddy of mine.
I could probably get him to endorse you.
Oh, man, that would be amazing.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Uh, you mean "the whiz palace.
" Leslie calls it that sometimes.
I know.
It's kind of cute, right? Yeah, that's real cute.
[Ben and Leslie laugh] - So, how is San D-- - I'm still in love with you.
- What did you just say? - Nothing.
I did--nuttin' was said.
Nuttin' was just now-- Did you just say you were still in love with me? No, I don't think I said that.
Dave, why would you tell me that here and now? Because it's accurate.
And because he's not here right now, so I thought this would be a good time.
Can I just please talk to you about this for five minutes? No, you cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here.
Okay, we'll get rid of him.
That's a good call.
No, bad call.
That's not the call.
Okay, if we leave now while he's in the whiz palace - No, listen to me.
Listen-- Hey.
Whizzingham manor.
It's another funny name for the bathroom That I thought of.
All: Catch your dream [Snaps fingers] All: and shackle it to your heart.
[Snaps fingers] - Catch your-- - No, no, no, no, no.
Was that a joke? Were you joking just now? Because if so, that was hilariously awfully funny how bad that was.
Why don't you take and really think about whether or not you want to be part of this? He's a gorgeous genius, people.
Don't question his methods.
Tom, am I to understand correctly that you are now romantically involved with Ann Perkins? Tsk.
Oh, are you about to give me the whole "she's a great girl, I need to treat her right" speech, - since you guys used to date? - No.
But she is, and you should.
I just had no idea, and so now I have to Adjust.
Tsk.
Okay, great talk.
Uh, how's work out there, Dave? Pretty good.
Caught a lot of bad guys, about six bad guys.
So you're leaving tomorrow? I'm scheduled to leave tomorrow on the 12:15 flight through Salt Lake City.
Oh, it was so good to see you.
- But I may be coming back.
- How's that, now? - Well, I'm mainly here to interview for Trumple's job-- - Police chief.
- Dude, that's amazing.
You should totally be chief.
You could endorse Leslie.
I would definitely endorse Leslie.
You don't have to.
There's a lot of good candidates.
I think I'm gonna take a little--go outside.
You look like I could use some company.
- What? - What? Would you like to step outside with me and catch up? We have caught up.
We talked about San Diego and about the six bad guys.
I think we're good.
I could take a little jaunt with you.
No, I don't want that.
Well, I'm already-- I already said I'm gonna go, so I guess--I'm a man of my word.
I'm gonna go.
- Take your time.
- Okay, thank you.
Okay, honestly, how do you think I'm doing? 'Cause I feel like we're getting along pretty well.
He said he's still in love with me.
What's that? While you were in the bathroom, he said he was still in love with me.
Oh, my God.
Leslie, he's a cop.
He's in love with you, and he has a gun? - Can you just not freak out? - I'm not freaking out! - Okay.
- I'm not freaking-- Uh [Laughs nervously] I know, that's--I know.
Uh, it was raining out, so I didn't want to get wet.
I got some hot tea with honey-- good for the voice.
I recommend you all try it.
Mine's really just a cup of honey, 'cause tea is gross.
Now, here's the thing-- we're gonna start from scratch.
We're gonna get rid of this whole sucky vibe.
I'm thinking we could-- Whoo! To the man! I was thinking, like, a crazy rock star vibe! See where her head's at? Follow her lead.
That was amazing.
Next thing, I want to hear how all of us sing on our own, so we can figure out where we're going wrong.
This is not an audition, so relax.
But if you don't sing good, you're out of here.
[Whispering] I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons.
I think you shouldn't whisper.
Yeah, Ann's mad at me now, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
I don't want to brag, but I have a ton of experience with women being mad at me.
Chris, you're first.
Sing anything you want.
- Let me hear it.
- Okay.
Take me out to the ball game take me out to the game I just want to be at the game I would like to eat at the game I'd like popcorn and candy and the home team at the game! Boom.
And the check, as you requested.
Here's my credit card-- quick, now.
- Check? - Yeah.
You like dessert.
Why don't you get a dessert? Oh, dessert's overrated and gross.
Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening.
Oh, actually, Ben, would you mind if I talked to Leslie alone? Uh, actually, Dave, I'd like to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to Leslie.
Well, I want to talk to you, and if not, then I'd like to talk to Leslie.
Well, I'd like to talk to Ben, and then I'd like the three of us to talk together.
Well, then I'll talk to Ben, and then you-- and then I'll talk to you, and then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then.
- All right.
- So who's talking now? All: Catch your dream don't let it spread its wings and fly away Stop the song, stop the song right now! Please, stop it! Oh, for [Bleep] sake.
Ann, I caught feelings for you, and I want you to be my girl, - [sighs] - And I don't care who knows.
I know you don't care, dummy.
I care.
Let's not get hung up on who wants what.
You know what? I'm calling this.
We're done.
What about our next date? If you want another date, keep walking away.
[Door slams] She's still walking.
I need you to know something, man-to-man.
I still have feelings for Leslie, in a womanly fashion, and I believe she feels the same towards me, in a manly way.
She doesn't feel the same way, because she has a boyfriend-- um, me, and--and-- and--and we love each other.
That's--that information is-- it's not pertinent - Well, I-- - Frankly, at this juncture.
I just said to you one thing, and you're "contraring" me.
I don't think that's a word.
I think we'd all appreciate it if you would just let me have three minutes with her alone.
Consequently, I'd like you to clear the area.
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna give my blessing for you to go and try and win my girlfriend away from me.
I think that that's reasonable.
Okay.
Okay, and I want to thank you.
I want to thank you for having this talk with me - Man-to-man.
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- What-- - what are you doing? - I'm doing that.
Are you serious? - You brought it on yourself.
- What? I've got something I gotta say to you.
- Where's Ben? - He left.
- He left? - Yeah, he said, "I got somewhere I got to-- important to go, and I don't respect her as a woman.
" He said that? And he acted more effeminate than he does in front of you.
Just--look, I got some-- something to say, and it's emotional, and it's important.
I need 30 seconds.
Okay, what? Go ahead.
What is it? Okay.
Romance-- [Cell phone ringing] Hello? Are you okay? Yeah.
I have to pee really bad, ironically.
What were you thinking? I was thinking that I would cuff him, and--and then I could have time to speak to you, and then you would decide to be with me, and then I would come back here, and we would uncuff him together.
Can you just uncuff him, please? Sorry.
Would you look at that? Nature is throwing me a bone.
Haverford playbook move number two-- "ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain.
" - D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d [humming] I never thought I'd say this to you, son, but you may be overthinking this.
This song has to be perfect, Ron, okay? Leslie trusted me with it.
I can't come up with some brilliant political idea, can I? This is the only way I can help.
Maybe if I hit my head against the ground.
That's worked before.
Leslie is going to love it, I promise.
No offense, Ron, but what do you know about music? Mm.
Tsk.
Hey, take a walk.
[Groans] Clear your head.
I bet it does you some good.
[Knuckles crack] [Claps hands] Ann? Boo-boo? I don't want to say, "I told you so," - but - What? I was the one who didn't want to go.
I know.
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
I'm sorry.
He was a very important person to me, and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly.
Let's just go home.
No, we're going to Trumple's thing.
No, let's not go there.
I don't care about the endorsement, and I don't want to put you through this any more.
You don't care about the endorsement? Leslie, let's not let your terrible decision making get in the way of this election.
What happened to you? I was waiting outside in the rain for you, 'cause I thought you would come out and be like, "aw, he's all wet.
That's so romantic," but you didn't, and now I got the "sniffness.
" What on earth would make you think I would like that? Movies.
Oh, God, Tom! Why do you have to be so "you" all the time? I'm sorry.
Will you help me get out of these wet clothes? [Light rock music] - Hey, you want a beer? - Oh, okay.
If you're driving, I can't give you a beer.
Oh, well, then, no, thank you.
It's a celebration, man.
You have to have a drink.
I'll definitely have one.
Don't make a mistake you'll always regret.
Please, just tell me what you want me to do.
So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends, but I love Ben.
He comes first, and if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever.
Okay, that's fair.
I-I'm sorry.
That was dumb, all that stuff I did.
You just-- you make me crazy, and I guess I'm just surprised that-- you know, that's the guy you fell in love with.
He's very--well, he's shrimpy, and he's small.
Shrimpy or not He's smart, and he's cute, and he's kind, and he's funny, and he's got a great face and nice hair, and he's-- Okay, I get it.
I surrender.
- [Laughs] - I just want to know that you're happy and you're protected.
I'm very happy.
And he's not shrimpy.
A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face.
Oh, good man.
I mean him, for doing that, not the guy who called you a bitch.
You tell me where he is.
I'll punch him, too.
All right, guys, here's the deal-- we got to completely start over.
I wrote a new song-- it's called The Promise Of Tomorrow's Wings.
It's brilliant-- about a billion times better than Catch Your Dreams, which I realize now sucks ass.
Hey, Chuck, go ahead and just delete everything, all right? Hold on, Chuck.
Just listen to the song one more time, and then make a decision.
[Scoffs] [Catch your dreams with saxophone] Where's that saxophone coming from? I don't know.
I don't know the first thing about music.
Shackle it to your heart Whoa, is that a new mix? It sounds way better.
See? You just needed to clear your head.
Hey, you guys, who is this? This looks just like-- [Cymbals clang] Ow, that was loud.
I am telling you that Leslie, in the long run, is so much better for this police department than Bobby Newport is.
[Men yelling] Gun! No, no, no, no! It's just a--it's paper.
It's--I was reaching for paper.
It's all right, boys.
Leslie has a plan to raise cops' pensions and increase benefits without cutting back on hours.
Newport's just gonna keep on buying you guys a couple new cars or some new uniforms, as always.
That guy's all about short-term solutions.
Pretty sweet sauce in there, eh, Ace? - What's wrong with you? - I don't know.
Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great, but really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's, and I locked that sucker up a long time ago.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about endorse ten beers into my mouth, 'cause this has been an incredibly stressful evening.
Nice work, guys.
Hey, a little tradition after Mouse Rat records, someone buys me booze-- who's it gonna be? All right, look, I know I messed up, but there's something I got to say to you.
No playbook, no gimmicks, just me, Tom, talking to you as a person.
Okay, I would like that.
Good, 'cause this is what I really want to say.
Baby, I'm sorry for how I acted but if you give me another chance I could be the boo of your dreams, girl so, when you're sleeping and you're dreamin' of a boo I want that boo to be me, I want me to be that boo so will you date me? - I'm saying date me - Okay, yes.
Fine, fine, fine! - Yes, I will.
- Baby, baby, baby, baby I will go out with you.
Enough, please! - Really? - Yes.
Dude, you wore me down.
Just stop singing, please.
The four sweetest words in the English language-- "You wore me down.
" Go ahead.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Oh, hey, Dave, go ahead.
- Uh, go ahead.
No, it's fine.
- No, no, no.
You're waiting.
It's your turn.
No, no, I'm not.
- You're not waiting? - No.
It feels like you're-- - I'm-- - It feels to me like you're being overly respectful of all these cops, and you're letting them go in - all in front of you.
- No, no, no.
I'm just standing here.
Why would you be standing just here? - I w--I-- I was just checking-- Get in the-- go in! Thank you so much.
- Morning.
- Hey.
Hey, can you approve this new design for the campaign poster? Oh, Ann, you beautiful, rule-breaking moth.
You know we can't talk about my campaign in here.
Seriously? It's a "yes" or "no" question.
When you're running for office, there are, like, a million rules of what you can and cannot do.
Yes.
And because I work for the government, I am not allowed to do anything campaign-related inside a government building.
Boss, I need your Herbie Hancock on this.
Outside.
It's kind of a pain in the ass.
But it's great exercise But it's a pain in the ass.
So Perd Hapley wants to do Thursday now.
Fine.
Did you finish the maintenance report? I did not finish it, but I will finish it.
So wait, what was your question again? The slogan? Okay, can I just come out there, so we can talk about everything? No, April, I need to keep my work separate, okay? Just think of it like a fun game.
Parks is inside.
Campaign is outside.
Parks is inside.
Campaign's outside.
Ooh, you know what would make it more fun? - What? - Oh, my God, this.
April.
### ### It's time, Leslie.
You have to take a leave of absence from the department.
Ron, that is ridiculous.
- We've talked about this.
- No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous.
Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department.
City council is a part-time job.
But campaigning is a full-time job.
Right now you're working and 50 hours a week on the campaign.
Well, I have time to spare.
I'm also volunteering at "Wheels For Meals On Wheels.
" We repair vans for "Meals On Wheels.
" You're a month behind on everything.
You forgot to file the weekly Parks Maintenance report.
You do it every week, and you forgot.
Things are falling through the cracks.
I'm pretty sure you've worn that sweater four days in a row.
Or I own four identical versions of the same sweater.
No, you don't, there's an old lollipop that's been stuck to the back since Tuesday.
That's the style now, Ron.
It's called "lollipopping.
" All the kids are doing it.
Leslie, you need to take a sabbatical.
Okay.
You know what, Ron? I accept your apology, I will not take a sabbatical, as we agreed, and we will never discuss this again.
Sorry, Ann.
You can't open this gift.
It's for the most beautiful girl in Pawnee.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, wait.
That's you.
Wow.
Yeah, and look, I got one too.
Matching His and Hers.
So I'm "Tommy's girl," and you're just "Tom"? Why not "Ann's man"? Nobody owns me, cupcake, not even you.
You can either burn these hats in a fire, or you can use a blowtorch.
How about this option? - We put the hats on-- - Don't say it.
We take everything else off.
These Kangol hats are exactly like the one Samuel L.
Jackson wore to the Latin Grammys.
- How could she not like them? - I don't know.
It's like somehow everything I do with her is wrong.
Dude, seriously, leave me out of this.
I kind of set up Tom and Ann, and now they won't stop asking me for advice, which is a really bad move on their part, because I really don't care what happens to them Or anyone.
Champion! Hey, bud.
I missed you.
Thank you so much.
I hope he wasn't a handful.
Not in the slightest.
As the Germans would say, "er ist ein wunder hund.
" - He is a wonder dog.
- Oh.
The dog training course I took was conducted entirely in German, and so now I'm fluent in German Words relating to dogs.
April and Andy went away for the night, and I looked after Champion here.
He's a mutt.
Half amazing, half terrific.
Ich bin ein three-legged dog.
Well, I took him to PetSmart.
I got him various toys, got him shots, got him groomed, and gave him plenty of exercise.
He's healthier than ever.
Wait, did his leg grow back? Aw, no, no.
That's okay.
- Andy, if I may-- - Yes.
Dogs tend to take on the personalities - of their owners-- - Mm-hmm.
So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too.
Who wouldn't? That sounds like an amazing day, right? Okay, well, thanks.
Bye, Champion.
Morning, Leslie.
Jerry, take that shirt off.
You look ridiculous.
Gayle gave me this shirt yesterday as a birthday present.
Oh, my God, Jerry.
I can't believe I forgot your birthday.
Leslie, it is okay.
I mean, let's face it, it's a tough one to remember.
My birthday is February 29th, so I only get one real birthday, you know, once every four years.
But it's great because my wife Gayle makes such a big deal out of it.
We go, we split a huge piece of cotton candy cheesecake from Cakey J's Cheesecake Facility.
And then, well, we hold hands for a while.
We listen to some Anita Baker.
She meets up with some friends, and I turn in early.
This is unacceptable.
Birthdays are important.
I'm so sorry we forgot yours.
I guess it just slipped through the cracks.
Yes, I guess it did.
Anyway, Happy Birthday to Jerry.
You are a kind and wonderful soul.
Thank you.
Also I need you to do some fecal contamination testing - at the reservoir.
- Now? Yes, go get a kit from maintenance, and I need you to check the water for bird dung.
Can I at least grab the gloves? Jerry, what are you doing standing here? - Our water has poop in it.
- Oh, my God.
Now Jerry is turning 64 this year.
- He's only 64? - 64 divided by 4 is-- - 16.
- 64.
So we're gonna throw him a Sweet 16 surprise party.
It's gonna be very special.
- The usual, cake and pop? - No, April, the unusual.
- Fish and pop.
- No.
- Cake and fish.
- No, no fish.
Jerry only gets a real birthday every four years.
And four years from now, who knows? He might be retired Or dead.
Let's start a pool.
Who wants retied? Who wants dead? - Dead.
- No.
- I got one dead.
- No.
- You need to take that? - Mm, no.
The campaign can wait, 'cause this is official Parks business.
Donna, can we use your lake house? How did you know about that? My family has a lake house up in the foothills, but we keep it quiet.
We're not big on hospitality.
The Meagles are a cold people.
Can we use your house? I suppose.
Bring your own towels.
Wow, Donna.
This place is beautiful.
Yes, it is, and it will stay that way.
These are the house rules.
No dirty shoes in the house.
Upstairs is Meagle space only.
And if you listen closely, that is the bubbling of the hot tub.
You do not have access to it.
If you follow these rules, we won't have a problem.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Ginuwine? - Mm-hmm.
Why do you have Ginuwine's platinum record on your wall? Why do you have a photo of you with Ginuwine at some place? Oh, have I never talked about this before? Ginuwine's my cousin.
Ginuwine? The Ginuwine is your cousin? How do I not know this? Who's Ginuwine? Ginuwine? Ginuwine is Ginuwine.
He's Ginuwine.
Saying his name over and over again is not going to help me.
He's an R&B singer.
Pony, Differences.
Do you really not know who Ginuwine is? I know that he's Donna's cousin.
When I'm dating someone, I have a list called my "oh-no-nos.
" A woman commits an "oh-no-no," it can end the relationship.
Not loving '90s R&B music is number three on the "oh-no-nos" list.
Girl doesn't even know who Ginuwine is.
Hey, boy.
How was the ride? Oh, hey, you want me to show you something? Okay.
Platz.
Steh Auf.
See, it's pretty cool, huh? Would you like me to teach you? Uh, whatever.
I mean, anybody can do that.
Toxic.
Merkel.
- Merkel.
- What is "Merkel"? She's the Chancellor of Germany.
Not only more jobs but better jobs.
I just did a phone interview while simultaneously decorating this house for Jerry's surprise party.
Totally multitasking, totally on top of all of it.
Crow for dinner tonight, Mr.
Swanson? Okay, we are locked and loaded.
Music is ready.
Slideshow is prepped.
- April, when does Jerry arrive? - How would I know? Who was supposed to invite Jerry? Guys, someone was supposed to invite Jerry.
It's his surp-- Crap, it was me.
I forgot to invite Jerry.
You need to take a sabbatical.
I'm not taking a sabbatical.
Is this because I forgot to invite Jerry - to his own birthday party? - It did seem like an oversight.
I have a prediction, Ron.
By the end of the night, you are going to take a bite of Jerry's cake, which incidentally, we need to pick up on the way home, and you are gonna say, "sabbatical, schmabbatical.
Leslie can do it all.
She's the best, and I'm stupid.
" That does sound like me.
Hey.
Here's a fun game.
Let's talk minimum acceptable thread count for sheets.
- Ooh, that does sound fun.
- Stop me when I hit it.
Ann, I'm at 600.
Are you really not stopping me? I have those cotton t-shirt sheets.
Huh? It's always the most beautiful ladies who hurt you the worst.
She's never seen a single Paul Walker movie? That's a huge "oh-no-no.
" She also "doesn't care" about Blu-ray? - She's a monster.
- April, this is serious.
I might have to break up with Ann.
Yeah, well, then break up with her.
But she's my dream girl.
Then don't break up with her.
Except she hates everything I like.
I own more pairs of Uggs than she does.
I was getting kind of sick of listening to Tom and Ann talk about their relationship, but then I remembered that alcohol existed.
Thank you, alcohol.
Jerry? Jerry.
Where the hell could he be? Maybe someone else had a surprise party and actually remembered to invite him.
Jerry? Jerry.
Jerry? Jerry! Come on in.
- Oh, God.
- Leslie.
Hello, Jerry.
Jerry, why did you call us in here? Well, because I thought you were Gayle.
What are you doing in my bathroom? Yes, Leslie, what are we doing in Jerry's bathroom? There is a Parks emergency that only you can help us solve, so we need you to get out of the tub.
Let's get going.
O-okay, jes--w-- I gotta get dressed.
- No, there's no time.
- There's time, Jerry.
Get dressed.
Okay, well, what is the big emergency? Oh, did we lose more seniors in the woods? No, it's a sinkhole, right? Crap on a catapult.
They screwed up my campaign signs.
Now I gotta deal with this.
Okay, but what about the sinkhole? Don't worry, Leslie will deal with this and the sinkhole.
Right, Leslie? Yes, Ron.
I will, Ron.
And I shall do it with aplomb.
What the hell is wrong with Tom? Don't know.
It's like I'm dating some idiotic game show host.
He is driving me crazy with these stupid questions.
Well, soon it won't matter.
Why? What did he tell you? Nothing.
Wait, is he gonna break up with me? I don't know.
I'm-- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
That's not how this ends, okay? I break up with him.
I think I will celebrate with a drink.
Quit pulling.
Fine, I'll let you off the leash.
- Andy.
- What the [Bleep], dude? Where did you come from? I think that Champion should stay on his leash.
There's unfamiliar terrain and strange smells.
No, leashes are just for dogs that bite people.
That's not true.
Chris, Champion's my dog, okay? He's not going anywhere.
Sometimes you just have to let a dog be a dog.
He'll be all right.
Champion! He'll come back.
So as you can imagine, we would never have ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we're not insane.
See right here on the order form? - Mm-hmm.
- I can read the sign.
- It does.
- ".
com/imagescmyk/--" - well, but this isn't what-- - "page/carnpaignlqty100123--" You don't need to read the whole thing.
- "9u/09230023--" - Mm-hmm.
"099twposter--" - it does say that.
- ".
jpeg.
" Jpeg.
Yes, Walter, it does say that.
You're right, but using basic logic and human intelligence, one can surmise that this is a link to an image.
This isn't what we wanted printed on the signs.
Whatever's on the order form I print.
In this case, it was a long string of letters and numbers.
Can I just sh--show you something here? There you go.
That's highly against protocol.
Well, here, look.
That's a good sign.
You should've used that.
You told April you were breaking up with me? Ann, we consistently disagree on "who wore it best.
" You still use an iPad one.
You read books all the time.
Okay, how about my "oh-no-nos" for you? You make me see terrible movies, and then you talk through them.
"You put 20" rims on your volkswagen golf, and you insist on being introduced as "the brown Gosling.
" Everything you just said makes me like me more.
I can't take it any more, okay? I'm breaking you up.
You guys are done.
- Fine with me.
- Fine, fine.
- Oh, April.
- I'm drunk.
You made me drunk, you made me drunk, and you-- - No, no.
Give it a rest.
- I need it.
- Okay.
- Fine.
Let's get you to bed.
You know, why are you guys even fighting anyway? It's so stupid.
"I hate Ann because of this stupid reason.
" "And I hate Tom for this stupid reason.
" Who cares? - You want some help? - No, I got it.
Well, we did everything, Ron.
We got new signs.
We put them in people's yards.
We got Jerry for the surprise-- sinkhole emergency.
And, uh, we briefly ran out of gas, and then we walked to the gas station.
We got more gas, and now we're all good.
Yep, you truly are attempting to do it all.
Thank you.
We didn't get to the drug store for my liver medication.
Well, you should've thought about that before we dragged you out of the bath, Jerry.
Yeah.
Okay, wait a second.
This is clearly not a sinkhole problem.
What's going on? Jerry, as soon as we open this door, everything will become clear.
Surprise! Oh, what the [Bleep]? Surprise.
Where the hell is everybody? Well, it got so late.
We just weren't sure you were still coming.
Everybody's either in bed or out looking for Champion.
Oh, yeah.
Champion ran away.
- Wake everybody up.
- Leslie.
No, I am not gonna let this fall apart.
We are gonna throw Jerry an amazing Sweet 16 surprise party no matter how agonizing it is for all of us.
That's the spirit.
- Champion.
- Champion! Champion, come here, boy.
I have an organic, gluten-free soy bone for you.
Champion! Chris, there's something I have to tell you.
- I ate one of your soy bones.
- Really? Yeah, it was really good.
I was gonna give it to Champion, but it just-- it looked so yummy.
The point is, I'm a terrible dog owner.
And I think, if we find Champion, you should keep him.
Andy, if it wasn't for you and April, Champion would still be back at the pound.
You gave him a home.
That's amazing.
And he's your dog.
If you just call out his name, he will come to you.
What--no, he won't 'cause I've been trying it, and it didn't work.
I think he likes your music.
Why don't you sing to him? Really? I don't have my guitar.
- I usually-- - Come on.
I feel naked without it, okay.
### Champion, you're lost ### ### and soon you'll be found ### ### I rescued you from the pound, ### something something ### ### oh man ### ### on the ground ### ### get on out of here ### Champion! Champion, hey! Oh, buddy, you came back.
You came back to my voice.
Dog whistle.
- April, wake up.
- Jerry's here.
April.
- April.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Why is your arm around her? I broke you up.
Well, we got back together again 'cause of what you said.
What do you mean? I didn't say anything.
Yeah, when we were carrying you to bed, you correctly pointed out that we were arguing about stuff that was stupid, and so we talked it out.
And I apologized, and he apologized.
And now everything's great.
- Thanks.
- No.
I'm drunk.
Don't listen to me, no.
- See you out there.
- No.
- Whoa, thanks, guys.
This is really-- this is really great.
Okay, I want everyone to go around and tell their favorite Jerry story.
A positive one.
Who's first? Jerry, today is your birthday, but it's about much more than that.
It's also about Ann and I getting back together and being the hottest couple in Pawnee.
I'd also like to announce our official relationship mash-up name.
It's "Tan.
" To Tan.
I would like to announce that the name Tan is officially over.
To the end of Tan.
- Haverkins it is.
- Okay, Donna? I would like to address the fact that rule number seven says, "no pets," and yet there is a three-legged animal - in my living room.
- Okay, Ron.
Jerry's work is often adequate.
I'll go.
Jerry has a wife and three beautiful daughters-- a full life-- and that's amazing.
April and Andy have Champion, and that's amazing.
I have a stepbrother who lives in London and 2.
8% body fat.
Guys guys What do I do? I mean, she's asleep.
You probably should just sit there and not move.
She's really tired.
Just a few hours.
Few hours? Is this all the eggs we have? Yes.
What are you making? Eggs.
- Leslie.
- Surprise! Oh, God.
What happened? Well, you slept with Jerry last night.
No, I was planning Jerry's morning surprise party.
Morning surprise parties are always the best.
- Let's get going.
- I made some coffee.
Let's go for a walk.
I now officially insist that you take a sabbatical.
- No, no.
- Let me finish.
I used to work in a sheet metal factory, but then a job came along at the tannery.
The hours were better, and I would get paid.
Also I'd have the chance to work with leather both before and after it was on the cow, which had always been a dream of mine.
I didn't want to give up my sheet metal job, so I tried to do both jobs and finish middle school.
How old were you? The point is, I was so tired, I tried to puncture an eight-gauge aluminum foil with a leather awl.
- Wow.
- I learned a lesson.
Never half-ass two things.
Whole-ass one thing.
So if you want to win that seat-- Which I do.
Then commit yourself 100%.
Take a sabbatical.
I will cut back to 10 hours a week.
Deal.
- 15.
- 10.
Deal.
Ugh, I can't believe I got them back together.
Now they're always gonna want to come talk to me about stuff.
Eh, that's a good thing, babe.
They want to talk to you because you're important to them.
Yes, but I hate them.
I know you do, sweetheart.
Oh, hey, uh, by the way, I think that Chris is lonely, so I told him he could borrow Champion whenever.
- Andy, he's kissing me.
- Aww.
Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party.
- Oh, that's okay.
- But we all pitched in.
And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.
Muncie? Amazingly, yes.
Muncie, Indiana.
Thank you, guys.
It was really expensive.
- Oh, campaign.
- Take it.
Excuse me.
If the Bread and Breakfast This is Leslie.
This is "The Final Word with Perd.
" With your host, Perderick L.
Hapley.
Issue number one is the first issue we're going to talk about.
Is Bobby Newport's campaign for city council in trouble? When I say your names, I want you to respond.
Dylan.
Well, Newport's poll numbers have been plummeting.
They just fired his campaign manager, and where's Bobby? He's on vacation in Spain.
He's not on vacation, he's in hiding.
Every time the guy speaks, he puts his foot in his mouth.
That's a hilarious image.
A foot in a mouth.
It's a common expression.
Okay.
According to the newest polls, Leslie knope is now in second place.
She's just 15 points back.
Whoa, yeah! How did she close the gap? You have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager, Ben Wyatt.
So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass.
Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.
Every move he's made has worked.
He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird.
What did you just say? Nothing.
Keep up the good work.
You're doing great.
Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote.
And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones.
He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.
He's like The Godfather but old.
He's like The Grandfather.
The Grand Godfather.
The "grond" father, he's like-- It doesn't matter.
He's important, and he's old.
Mr.
Jones, such a pleasure to meet you.
Please don't get up.
Don't worry.
I can't.
- Oh.
- Just joking.
I can get up.
But it's difficult.
But I can do it, but it is hard.
Look, I don't have a lot of time.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Is it cancer? No, I don't have a lot of time before my swim aerobics.
Oh.
Why are you better for seniors than Bobby Newport? Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.
Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.
Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind "everything hurts" and "I'm dying.
" You wanted to see me.
Good God.
What the hell are you doing? Upside-down sit-ups.
Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective.
Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that? The world's my gymnasium, Ron.
But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.
Could you hold me while I dismount? - Thanks so much.
- You bet.
Question for you.
In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees.
You have only seven.
Why is that? I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.
The department is so small because Leslie Knope single-handedly does the work of four people.
And she's already scaled back her time.
If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council.
I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.
No! Chris, that's unnecessary.
The department is doing fine without Leslie.
Then prove it.
Complete one major project.
Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core.
Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.
I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them.
And they were delicious.
Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town.
Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game.
Damn straight.
This is very impressive.
You know, you remind me of my brother.
You have the same name, Leslie.
He lost a third of his body in a motorcycle accident.
The middle third.
But they sutured the hell out of him.
He's-- he's fine now.
Much shorter, but a good-looking, young, flat man.
What have you heard about Newport's new campaign manager, Jennifer Barkley? Uh, who? She wants to have a meeting with me at 5:00.
I told her sorry.
I don't talk politics after dinner.
Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.
Wow, she worked with James Carville? She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.
Yeah, and check out this picture.
She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.
That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.
Why are you smiling? Why is this terrifying information making you smile? Newport's scared.
I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her.
- So what do we do next? - I'm going to set up a meeting.
I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you.
And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.
Home field advantage.
As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body.
Hello, Ann Perkins.
This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.
Nonsense.
We are close friends.
I have good news for you.
I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.
Oh, great.
For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts.
It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk.
Kiss one water-fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee.
Including him.
I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.
Oh.
Set up shop in our office.
In fact, take Leslie's desk.
Okay, I will.
Thanks.
Great.
Do you want the door open or shut? Ah, open's fine.
Okay.
Hello, Marta.
We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone.
You mean Ms.
Barkley.
She's already here.
Last booth.
Leslie Knope.
Hi.
I'm Jen Barkley.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Grab a seat.
Thanks.
Sorry about all these papers.
I had them shipped in.
I'm a news junkie.
Is this in Arabic? Well, I've been reading up on you two.
Ben, it's a great job on this campaign.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke.
This is federal government caliber.
Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here? This campaign seems beneath you.
Yeah.
Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.
I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron.
So I was, like, "sorry, Nick.
Your son is a moron.
There's no way.
" Then he offered me a crazy amount of money.
I shouldn't even tell you how much.
But I will.
$250,000.
Good lord.
For six weeks of work? I know.
Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington.
Do you know Joe Biden? Oh, mm-hmm.
He's on my celebrity sex list.
Well, he is my celebrity sex list.
Oh, trust me.
You can do better than Joe.
Oh, no.
I don't-- I don't think I can.
No way.
Oh, man.
I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.
Now I kind of hope you win.
She's just doing this for the money.
She doesn't even like her own client.
This could be the best case scenario for us.
Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.
Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.
Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America.
She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her.
- Oh, God.
- What? Wow, strong words from a powerful lady.
So I guess we both agree.
Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.
Worst case scenario.
Worst case scenario! I'm Leslie Knope and when I grow up, I want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor.
Wrong.
Not in my town, kid.
City council's a real job for a real adult.
It's playing every hour on every channel.
It's official.
I hate Jennifer Barkley.
When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her.
Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message.
We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement, - and that's huge.
- You're right.
And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king.
Do you wish I were taller or-- what's going on? Nothing.
You're perfect.
Okay, everyone.
So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.
Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.
Andy is our official water-fountain tester.
All right, let's give this sucker a test-drive.
Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to.
Ah, that's good.
Okay, any ideas? Jerry? Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it.
Okay.
That could work.
Andy? Yeah.
Thank you, Andy.
Ah, still good.
- Tom? - Full disclosure.
Ann and I are romantically intertwined.
Oh, God.
So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.
Would you just go, dummy? What's the best kind of water fountain? How about no water fountain? This is the Voss Water Butler by Tumi.
And only $600 a bag.
April, what's your idea? To go in that room and finish this book.
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Is it good? - Yeah.
You're going to stay here, and you're going to help.
Donna? Do I look like I drink water? Yoo-hoo.
I'm over here.
Just about to start my presentation.
I-- uh-oh, stairs.
What do I do? How do I get from here to there? I'm not a professional mountain climber.
It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee.
We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game.
Yeah.
Ramps are an idiot's game.
This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.
What plan? Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.
Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan? Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.
Come on out here, Ned.
Ned Jones is here.
Say hello to Ned Jones.
Make way for Ned Jones.
Why don't we just turn up the pressure? That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.
All right, here we go.
Ah, stop! Honey, I'm sorry.
That'll teach you to pay attention.
I have an idea.
Um, I was thinking, "what if we did "something like this?" Oh, my-- dude, what the hell? Bobby Newport's plan is called "Rise Up! Pawnee.
" He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town.
Wow.
Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work.
Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree? Give him a hand.
As President of Seniors United, I endorse Bobby Newport.
I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.
I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.
Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project.
Incoming! Got you! Donna, don't! Excuse me.
Help, everything I'm wearing is suede! Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede! Excuse me, everybody.
Attention! I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.
Kamikaze! Oh.
"Stumbling for the first time in months, "the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down "a ramp to nowhere.
" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country.
He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Sorry, I wish I was better at this.
Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Maybe we take the fight to her? I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea.
That sounds good.
Okay, I'll just do that.
I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there.
Hey.
Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.
And sorry we goofed around so much.
Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did.
This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.
Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office? I think so.
We may be in for a good, old-fashioned shake-up.
Jennifer Barkley.
You two-faced, carpetbagging-- Hi, Leslie.
Good to see you.
Hi, nice to see you, too.
You are a two-faced, carpet-- You want anything? Anything? It's on me.
Everything in this town is so cheap.
I would never accept anything from a two-faced, carpetbagging-- - Leslie.
- Please.
Let me get my insults out.
I've been practicing it the whole way over here.
I sense that you're angry.
Tell me why.
Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work.
Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts.
My idea is better.
Oh, I don't doubt it.
The fact is I don't care.
Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan-- I don't actually care about any of this.
I'm just trying to win.
Look, it's not personal.
I like you.
But my job is to beat you.
So have a seat.
I'll get you some of those waffles you love.
- How do you know that-- - It's my job to know.
- God, you're good.
- I know.
Hi, guys.
What's so imporant? Well, after yesterday's hands-on brainstorming session-- Water balloon fight.
Fair enough.
We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.
Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.
Huh? What? We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it.
Well, I'll-- I'll try it.
- I did it.
- Good job, babe.
Simple, elegant, and cost-effective.
If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void.
I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.
- Oh! - Oh! I'll give it up for that.
So what's Ben's next move for you? Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that.
Oh, let me guess.
Um, you're going to attack me.
You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours.
It's "Perd," first of all, and no.
Maybe.
No.
That's not a terrible idea.
No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea - Which you did.
- Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goody-goody nerd.
Because you know what people don't care about? They don't care about whose idea was first.
They care about whose idea was best.
Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't.
Mm-hmm, okay.
What would you do instead? Oh, Leslie.
I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.
- Right.
- Ah, what the hell.
If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself.
You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.
No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, "you can never spend too much on seniors.
" - Of course.
- You need to beat our idea.
Come up with something better.
I don't know.
Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.
All right, that could work.
Wow.
Waffles and a cappuccino.
Gracias, Marta.
JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.
Oh, it does now.
I bought them one.
Course you did.
You talked to Barkley without me? I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.
And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.
Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager.
But what if she's right? Well, what if it's a trick? I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work.
Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it.
But she knows that I know that she knows that-- She's in our heads.
I'm sorry, Leslie.
She's better at this than I am.
Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you.
- Really? - Yes.
So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager? I don't know.
Okay.
I'd like to talk about your future.
Why are we on this bench? This is weird.
You did a great job solving that problem today.
The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking-- I didn't solve that problem.
April did.
Really? Why did she tell me you did? Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something.
If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer.
Perhaps you're right.
Should I go? Oh, you're still here? Yes.
Let's begin the show by starting it.
Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas.
Well, uh They did, they stole our idea.
We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.
Oh, Perd.
This is politics as usual.
The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee.
Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper.
There she goes again, Perd.
I don't know where she went the first time.
Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors.
And our flash poll seems to agree.
Some 78% of those we surveyed prefer the Newport plan to the Knope plan.
This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.
Let's get back on track.
I just think o opppposition is losing sight of what all this is about.
What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about.
What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.
Excuse me? Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it.
It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads.
It was in the Pawnee papers.
Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.
It's certainly not here.
And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do.
Well, we were going to keep this sececret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee.
And that woman that he is with is an antiland-mine advocate.
I didn't realize that you were proland-mine.
I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner.
Thank you.
Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial.
I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert.
- She kicked our asses.
- Yeah.
How are we going to beat her? I don't know.
I mean, she's like a hurricane.
She's everywhere.
Literally.
Hi, guys.
You really stepped up your game.
That was really fun.
You almost got me.
I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.
What are you talking about? Oh, that thing I said on the show? Oh, no.
That was mostly made-up.
Don't challenge me on that.
That will backfire.
Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys.
I already took care of the bill.
- Another round, please? - Mm-hmm.
Nice job on the water fountain.
- It wasn't me.
- Don't deny it.
I know it wasn't the nurse.
I'm asking you to step up.
Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack.
I don't want to do things.
I want to not do things, just like you taught me.
And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain.
And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.
I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you.
Please.
Okay But only because you begged.
Good girl.
Chris Traeger.
This is Ron Swanson.
April's going to take over some of Leslie's responsibilities.
Excellent.
I have been a fan of April since day one.
I told-- 
It's my new interview outfit.
Like, "hey, nice to meet you.
" Can't wait for the interview.
" Um, I--maybe the h-- - maybe the hat.
- Yeah.
Lose this? To win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky.
Buddy Wood hosts the number-one morning show in Indianapolis, and he wants to interview me for a series he's doing on local elections.
And last year the five people that he profiled all won.
This is a huge break for us.
Um hey.
M-maybe we should put a pause on the fashion show.
We have to go over your talking points.
Keep going.
I can still hear you.
Um, okay, Ms.
Knope, what is going to be your first major public works project? Oh, I don't know.
But I bet these pants will work for the public.
- Whoo! - Yeah, those pants look dope! - Right? - Oh, my God, those look great.
And I bet they look even better on Ben's floor.
- Oh! - Are you hitting on Leslie for me? Wait a second.
Just turn around.
What? Oh.
It says "Nympho" on the butt in silver, sparkly letters.
Nympho means you're addicted to sex, and since it's on the butt, there's other implications as well.
So those are a maybe.
Who was Laura Mulvey? Laura Mulvey was - A guy - Girl.
Right.
Women's studies.
They're all girls.
Laura Mulvey was a feminist film critic who Wrote a major essay that helped shift the orientation of film theory to the psychoanalytical framework! Treat, please.
I'm about to take my first-ever final for my women's studies class.
Treat! Usually, tests scare me, but this is an oral exam.
Uh, and if there's one thing I know is-- My fantastic-- it's talk.
God, I don't know.
Man, I'm so nervous.
I know--I'm just gonna call the Professor, and then I'm gonna get on the phone and make some fake barfing sounds, and then I'm just gonna bail, so give me my phone.
No! Andrew That's now how grown-ups handle tough situations.
- Well, I-- - We face our fears head-on.
Told you--if you can't remember what some woman did, just tear up and say, "she changed my life.
" Ah, that's a good call.
I think this is it.
But do I need a hat, like a bowler, or an edgy scarf? No, those endless scarves that come out of your sleeves like a magician.
UmI think you should just go with something basic-- No nonsense.
Mr.
Wood, hello.
God, he is more tightly wound than ever.
Maybe we should see if he can pull that rod out of his butt and we can hang some of those outfits on it.
Ann and I have the occasional rough patch in our relationship.
But right now, we're really in a groove.
We've gone 30 hours without breaking up.
Our personal best is 47 hours.
It happened when she was out of town for two days and she forgot we were dating.
Well, let me know if anything changes.
Thank you.
- Interview's off.
- What? Buddy has to fly back to Indianapolis early-- something about a factory explosion.
Come on, did anyone even get hurt? Sorry.
First stroke of luck we've had, and it's gone.
Okay, well, we just have to work harder.
I mean, good news is, we can call it a night and get a super-early start on our door-to-door tomorrow.
Ooh, that is great news.
And, you know, we might even be able to make it back in time for boring club.
Do you know who the president or boring club is? Me? Nope You lost the election 'cause your speech was too boring.
Hey, why don't we all go get a drink, blow off some steam? Everybody's been working so hard.
UmWell, we're in the homestretch here, and losing that interview didn't help.
I'm gonna go over some polling numbers and turn in early.
I suggest you do the same.
Hey, Leslie, give you a ride home? Ah, screw it.
I got a new outfit.
My hair looks amazing.
And I have a serious excess of pre-interview adrenaline.
Who's gonna drink with me? - Ooh - Oh Susan Bronwell, or B.
, Anthony-- was born in Adams, Massachusetts, in 1820, and she played a pivotal role - in the institution of women's suffrage.
- Andy - Treat, please.
- Andy, slow down.
You're taking this class pass/fail.
So I'm just looking for a freewheeling discussion about, you know, what you got from the class.
Oh.
Okay.
I would say what I find very cool about Susan B.
Anthony is How She was born in Adams, Massachusetts, in 1820.
You know? Just one man's opinion.
I passed! I got a "P"! - Congrats, babe.
- Yeah! Mmm! I was hoping for a P-plus, but that does not exist.
- Right? - Right.
Yes, so, basically, best grade in the class-- tied for the best grade in the class.
Ron, I am a college graduate now.
- No, you're not.
- I'm a college course Graduate, and it's all because of you.
It's my pleasure, son.
I'm really proud of you.
How about a steak? - Yeah! - You guys have a good time.
Oh, Professor, why don't you come with us? - Is that cool? - Sure.
We'll let you pay for your own food, because of equality.
I guess now that the class is over, there's nothing wrong with it.
Are you gonna wear that? Okay, I'm calling it.
I have a date with my bathtub, a glass of red wine, and a gigantic fireman named Marcus.
I'm gonna keep plugging away for a bit.
You don't mind this work, do you? Uh-uh.
I like it.
It makes sense to me.
Mmm.
This was such a good idea.
Should we get another round? Um I think we should get a more basic, no-nonsense beverage.
Uh maybe we should all just drink sensible portions of milk.
I mean, I love him.
It's just This campaign has turned fun, dorky Ben - into grumpy, stress-ball Ben.
- Mm.
It's like dealing with a strict mother who I am confusingly attracted to.
- Mm.
- Ben is like a MILF.
You just need to blow off some steam.
- He should just get that.
- Yeah.
- You're Leslie Knope! - Right! No one takes this more seriously than you do! - Tell me about it! - Yes! - Tequila shots? - Ohh! To Knope 2012.
Mm.
Ahh.
Ding-dong.
Oh.
Hello.
Lady Knope.
I mean Leslie Knope.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Ben.
Where are you? I'm in, uh, the house watching TV right now.
I'm watching, um Murder She Wrote.
Murder She Wrote.
I'm watching Murder She Wrote.
Amazing news-- Buddy Wood's flight was delayed.
So, if we can get to the airport right now, the interview's back on.
What? Wow! Whay could be wrong with that? Nothing.
Anyway, here comes me - To the airport.
- Great.
I'll see you there as soon as possible.
Okay, bye.
The interview is back on! - Whoo! Yes! - I know! We are so "drucky.
" I mean "lunky.
" Ok, both the cabs in this town are busy.
But I still had eight hours rental time on that hot-tub limousine that I got for your campaign event, - and it's on its way.
- That's smart.
You're smart.
Diddly diddly diddly diddly swag.
- You did it right! - I did it right.
- Ah! - Ha ha! Okay, look, this interview is a big deal, you guys.
This is a game changer, okay? I have to do well.
Listen, let's do practice interview Big idea, Ann.
- And see how you do.
- Let's go.
Leslie, in your humble opinion What? - Why are you from Russia? - I don't know.
Hey, Ron is the guy I wrote about for that paper on positive male role models.
Oh, yeah, that was one of your most readable papers.
According to Andy, you're quite the feminist.
I don't consider myself an anything-ist, but my life has been shaped by powerful women.
My father once told my mother that woman was made from the rib of Adam, and my mom broke his jaw.
My Uncle Lon once tried to Is that Chris? You know, it really looks like him.
But there's no way to know for sure.
We should ask him tomorrow.
Hey.
April Ludgate.
Why are you here eating alone? I'm not.
I'm surrounded by friends Friends I don't know yet.
And I'm engrossed in this book.
It's the true story of a woman born with no arms and no legs who attempted to swim the English Channel.
- That's impossible.
- Oh, she drowned immediately.
It's kind of a sad story.
Cool.
I'm over there with people you actually know If you want to come join us.
Thank you.
Bye, friend.
Bye.
I'm sorry, Marcus, I'm gonna have to cancel our bath.
Something interesting is happening.
I want to watch it.
I don't know, Marcus.
I'll hit you up when I hit you up.
Wow, I feel totally normal.
I'm ready to do this.
Thank you for accommodating us on such short notice.
Hey, for Leslie Knope, anytime.
Just let me know if you need anything else, all right? Thanks, Paul.
Hey, you got those new I.
D.
Badges.
They finally upgraded us-- - security swipe and everything.
- Wow, look at that.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
Hey, thanks again for fighting for them.
"Helpy" to hop out.
Leslie Knope.
Buddy Wood.
- Buddy Wood.
- Glad you could make it.
Glad you could make it.
Thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the greatest city in the world.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're being serious.
We're setting up over there, found a small piece of carpet without a horrifying smellscape.
I'll be right there.
Hey, do I seem normal to you? Like, does everything seem fine? - Yeah, yeah--you seem fine.
- I seem okay? - Uh-huh.
- I don't seem distracted or babbly or anything? No, it's great.
So you're gonna do great.
- You're gonna do smart.
- What's that? - Look who I found.
- Hi.
Professor Linda, this is Chris.
Chris, this is Professor Linda? It is a genuine pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, you as well.
- Hi, there.
Would you like to hear our specials? No need.
Porterhouse, rare, quickly.
Same.
I'll have the, uh, spinach salad.
What kind of dressings do you have? Oh! Linda, in case you're interested, I brought my own dressing.
You really can't be doing that.
Well, this is the last time.
I promise.
It contains extra-virgin olive oil, a little bit of lemon, and hint of turmeric.
Sounds great.
Pawnee, Indiana, home to the Sweetums Candy Corporation, and not much else.
This sleepy mini-Metropolis is the site of a fascinating city council race.
Joining us today is one of the candidates, Leslie Knope.
Leslie, welcome to Good Morning.
It's my pleasure.
Thank you for being on my show.
Leslie, we're here at the Pawnee municipal airport, which I must add is rather decrepit.
Well, I'm glad you mentioned it.
It is in desperate need of refurbishments.
And that is why I'm going to make it a centerpiece - of my platform.
- Okay.
Take, uh Joe Appledemas over there.
Joe, say hi.
Hello.
Joe has been working here since 1996, and his salary has not been raised a nickel.
I am gonna work very hard to change-- Okay, this airport seems to me like a metaphor.
Are you familiar with the term? Pawnee's airport is symbolic of the town-- out of touch, out of date, perhaps, lost, insignificant, and sad.
Your thoughts? Well, granted, we don't have big-city amenities, but I think we more than make up for it with friendly faces and hand-working hards-- hardworking hands.
If you say so.
I say it's sad.
Moving on Oh, my God.
If they got together, they would make the most beautiful super baby.
It would rule us all.
But what if super baby became too powerful? I guess we'll just have to take that chance.
Chris got dumped by Jerry's daughter.
He needs this.
Plus, if they get married, he'll spend all his time with her, and I might never have to talk to him again.
Hmm.
Professor Linda, you have Really nice arms.
- Oh? - Do you work out? I was gonna say the exact same thing.
But I didn't want you to think that I was objectifying you with my male gaze.
May I see? Oh, sure.
Oh, my good gracious.
You have - extraordinary caput laterale.
- Thank you.
There's nothing more important than physical health.
- I agree.
- Kendra? - Yes? - You know what? I am gonna have that third steak after all.
Go ahead and put that order in now, please, and thank you.
Your campaign hit a snag of sorts, with the revelation that you and your boss, Ben Wyatt, were having une affaire de coeur-- affair of the heart.
Well, I've discussed that many times, and there's really nothing more to say.
I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.
Good luck with that.
But getting back to your affair with Ben Wyatt, who's now your campaign manager Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that.
But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks.
I don't.
I'd like to talk about you and Ben Wyatt.
Uh-oh.
I know that look.
- She's got the crazy eyes.
- Yeah.
Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone.
But you know what? I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell? Ben and I first I'm sorry, Ms.
Knope, are you inebriated? What? No.
Preposterous.
-Are you ine-- --Ebriated? That was bad timing.
This is a Buddy Wood first-- an exclusive interview with potential city councilwoman Leslie Knope, who appears to be drunk right now on camera.
I am not drunk.
Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk.
Is it this sad, pathetic town that makes you drink this way? - This interview is over.
- Okay, Ms.
Knope.
Oh-- This-- this is not because I'm drunk.
This is because of the wire.
A fitting end to a bizarre interview and a sad moment in a depressing city with no hope, in the waning moments of the bitter saga that has been a contentious campaign.
C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape.
Are you kidding? This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.
The sheep that watch my show are gonna eat this up like tiramisu.
Tiramisu is an Italian dessert often-- I know what tiramisu is, okay? - And sheep don't eat it.
- Sorry, but Tomorrow morning this gets broadcast around the entire Indiana-sphere.
Thank you for celebrating the most ultimate triumph of my life.
I'm very proud of me, and you are too.
And, Professor, I'm taking your class again next semester.
And I'm gonna lock down that P-plus.
It's impossible.
You and the women taught me that nothing is impossible.
Alright, I better be going.
- I have to get up early.
- Good-bye.
I'm teaching a morning Zumba class for retirees.
Before I do, Linda, do you enjoy land kayaking? It's quite fun.
Well, it's more grueling than fun.
But I would love to take you.
I'm really flattered, but I just got out of a relationship, and I think I need a little more time before I jump into anything.
Of course.
I understand.
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate your caution.
- Thank you.
- I hope to see you again.
Good-bye, everyone.
Anybody want to go to JJ's for some after-dinner omelets? Or how about you and I go back to my place? Yes.
Wow! Ben, I am so sorry.
Let's just focus on the problem.
Now, if we don't stop that interview from airing in the morning, this campaign is dead.
So We have to go to Indianapolis.
- And do what? - I don't know, Tom.
I guess we'll just set fire to the studio or something.
Ah, that's so sweet-- I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before.
Ah, it gets old.
We still have six hours of rental time on the hot-tub limo.
We could take that.
No one would have to drive all night.
That's actually a good idea.
Plus, it allows for the possibility of high-speed skinny-dipping.
Ugh.
Ann, I was joking.
Come on, it was a joke.
It was funny.
Where we going, folks-- drive around, hit the strip clubs? - Yeah! - No.
We're going to this address in Indianapolis.
- Really? - Yeah.
You know, no one ever used this hot-tub limo for actual transportation.
And I can't take this thing on the highway, so it'll take a few extra hours.
Hey, is this a seven or a one? Jerry.
Jerry! Maybe you should wrap it up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
Is it really? Oh, my gosh.
Wow.
Well, that flew by, huh? I will just take these down to the post office and, uh, put the, uh Oh, jeez.
Oh, no.
I put the handout flyers in the mailing envelopes, and I was supposed to put these flyers in the envelopes.
Oh My God.
Well, you know, it's like I always say.
It ain't government work if you don't have to do it twice.
Here we go! I'll make some coffee.
Hey, you're blocking my driveway.
Leslie Knope? - What are you doing? - Hi, um Mr.
Wood, I'm so sorry.
We--oh, my God, I can't see.
It's so bright out here.
- Ohh.
- We drove here to ask you-- No, to beg you to please destroy that tape.
Yeah, I got your 50 messages.
Leslie was just out with her friends blowing off some steam.
- What? - Please.
Please.
Please, please, please.
That's five pleases.
As much as I enjoy the groveling, I can't destroy the tape because I don't have it, because your sad, tiny backwater airport lost my bags.
Oh, really? You'd think a commuter airport could handle the luggage of 11 people at once, but apparently not.
Completely ruined a great story.
Thank God for that mitten factory tragedy.
- Yeah.
- Mm.
- God, that's - Okay.
- Great.
Uh - We should--yeah.
- We're gonna go.
- Good-bye.
Ah, screw it.
Yay! Fun Ben lives.
April, Andrew Good morning to you both.
Doughnuts-- go nuts.
Hey, you kids need any money? - No.
- Go buy yourself a Walkman.
How much is a Walkman nowadays? Probably more than $20.
Here's $25.
Hi, guys, I just wanted to come by and thank you for a phenomenal evening.
Yeah, seems like we all had a phenomenal evening.
And I should probably thank you for introducing me to Linda.
I think we had a deep emotional connection that is very worth exploring.
So I'm gonna ask her out again When she's emotionally ready.
- Hmm.
- Hey, Ron Great red shirt.
Dude, Ronyou have to tell him what happened.
Why? It's none of his business.
Because he's been super sad lately.
It kind of seems like you should at least give him a heads-up so he doesn't get rejected again.
I like to not get involved in these matters or any matters of any nature.
Uh, you know, Ron, someone once told me that this is not how grown-ups deal with tough situations.
We face them head-on.
Fine.
Oh, my God, Ron It was you who told me that.
That's crazy.
There's that shirt.
Look, Chris After the bar last night, I engaged in consensual activities with Linda.
- I see.
- I didn't plan it.
But it occurred.
Now you know.
Well, thank you for being forthright and telling me.
You're a good man, Ron.
I'm quite lonely.
Ah, [Bleep].
They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky.
I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.
And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.
And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.
I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.
Actually, not all of it.
He's about to get lucky.
It's--it's on.
He doesn't even know it yet.
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetheart.
I'm not sure you're even aware of this, but we have now gone 48 hours without breaking up, shattering our previous record.
That's not bad.
- To celebrate - Oh, please, don't.
Whatever this is, I don't want it.
Just a little - Condoms.
- 48 of 'em.
Different flavor for each hour.
Yeah, we're not dating any more, okay? Get out.
- No, wait.
- Get out.
- Don't punish me.
- I took a risk.
- Yeah.
Bye.
Is the coast clear? What are you wearing? My sneak-around clothes.
Is he gone? Yeah, he's gone.
Come in.
You gotta see this.
Tom and I have been seeing each other for a few weeks, and I think I'm ready to say, "I love you" To his apartment.
I love you so much.
Look at all these blankets.
One on the ottoman, one on the chair, one on the couch here, feel.
Holy hell, that's soft.
Oh, my God, is that Yep! A whole shelf of coconut water.
I think I'm gonna cry.
This is like girl heaven.
Did he do all this just for you? No! He just lives like this.
He's deeply in debt, but you know what? Who cares! 'Cause check it out.
Cheese plate and Adriatic figs.
Leslie, this is always here.
I don't know when he has time to make it.
Boutique eye cream, unisex cologne, lip exfoliator, chocolate-covered almonds, and a Sudoku book just amenities everywhere! - I love amenities.
- I know! Check this out.
It's the best part.
Night and day.
Look at this one.
There's another soft one.
Ohh.
Councilman Pillner, could I have a moment? Make it quick.
In his seminal filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.
- Way quicker.
- Okay.
Well, but you should watch that documentary.
Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%.
Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen.
I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.
If you hear any of them talking about that "blonde pain in the ass," that's a-me.
Leslie, that budget is all but finalized.
I love building ships in bottles.
When the ship is done, I put a cork in it, put it on the shelf, and I move on.
Hold that cork, sir 'Cause I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts.
Meet Melody Sternway.
She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.
Our department is the only thing between her and a life of tube tops and tribal tattoos and barfing in hot tubs.
Please.
Okay, you got me.
I'll find the cuts somewhere else.
Good morning, everyone! I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.
So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.
What exactly is the chain of command vis-a-vis on-site response? You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge? Okay, so if there's an explosion, say, in Ramset Park and someone from Sewage gets there first, they'd be in charge? I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.
She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.
I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing? Just bouncing some business ideas off Russell Simmons on Twitter.
Why? All due respect, miss Ludgate, do you even know what you're doing here? All due respect, Mr.
hamster penis, but no, I don't.
- My last name is Guiles.
- Are you sure? Because you look like a hamster penis.
What about a cologne that can kill spiders? Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager.
Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist.
That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me.
I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.
I mean, I have so many ideas.
Some are simple like "take down traffic lights" and "eliminate the Post Office.
" The bigger ones will be tougher, like "bring all of this crumbling to the ground.
" There is one more step in the vetting process.
You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra.
I'm not sure I'm interested in that.
No, I am sure.
I am not interested in that.
Ron, you and I are very different people, and we have often been at odds.
It is crucial that you and I spend a day spiritually engaged, and consider what it would really mean to work together.
Trust me, you'll love it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, wear your yoga pants.
Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first.
What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget? I don't know.
That's the point.
You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate.
You're in a campaign literally.
Everything you do right now is politics.
Oh, really? Is this politics? Ow.
What is what is that? - What why did you do that? - I'm in a good mood.
Because the city councilor listened to me.
It means I have some juice.
Look, this might be a good thing.
But there's a reason we strategize - before we make decisions.
- Okay.
Okay.
I'll make some calls, see where we are.
- Enjoying the view.
- What is going on? I'm just really into you.
Gimme a spin, baby.
I hate doing Leslie's job.
I'm filling in for a person who smiles 90% of the time.
Tom, can you please help me? Please? Or just do it? Come on, lil sparkle.
Don't give up.
What does Leslie always say? I don't know, weird stuff about waffles.
She says, "you get out of a job what you put into it.
" You just need to find a project you're passionate about.
For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages.
The Beer-yonce Knowles.
It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexy-ass mug.
Pairs nicely with the Jay-zima.
We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.
That sounds fun.
Maybe I should work at a bar.
Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about.
Hello.
Here are some papers Leslie requested.
- These are blank.
- Weird.
As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question? Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris? Oh, yeah.
When we dated, he made me do it every week.
- What am I in for here? - Okay, here's the deal.
It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead.
Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants? Hey.
So did Pillner finalize the budget? Are we okay? - We are the opposite of okay.
- What do you mean? To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter.
The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs.
So they're closing it at the end of the week.
That's where Champion came from.
What will happen to all the other animals? - Well, they'll be - Fine.
No.
They'll be No! Guys.
Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter.
Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions.
Like, for example, is she a dog murderer? God.
Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes.
Say your good-byes, Pebble 'Cause "Weswie" Knope gonna kill you.
She got the perfect puppy for that shot.
She is good.
Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty.
- Okay, we can fix this.
- Yes, we can.
Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget.
No, no, no, no.
We can figure something else out.
Leslie! Hey, honey, good morning.
How did you sleep? I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Do you want pancakes? - I'm gonna make pancakes.
- Is that a pig? - What? Which one? - Is that a pig? You talking about this one? This one right here? Yes, that is a pig.
This is the best meditation center in the area.
It doesn't look like much.
Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi.
Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal.
But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude.
Excuse me, ladies.
On your right.
After you, Ron.
Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.
Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.
- I'll stand.
- Interesting technique.
Andy, look at this little guy! He's such a little runt.
Hey, there.
Hey, Tom, look.
Oh, I just had five cats on me at once! You wanna come in here and try to break my record? That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance.
Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.
What's your endgame here, my dear? This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.
Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool? April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show.
Ew.
I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.
They should be rewarded for not being people.
I hate people.
I'm very proud of you, April.
Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable.
Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise-canceling headphones.
Pigs are awesome! All told, we were in there about six hours.
And no, I was not meditating.
I just stood there, quietly breathing.
There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.
My mind was blank.
I don't know what the hell these other crackpots are doing.
Jerry, the puppies are going to the bathroom everywhere.
We can't let people see that.
I need you to continuously clean out the cages, okay? - You got it, boss.
- Thank you.
Donna, did you put the info sheets on all the cages? - Last one.
- Great.
Each animal has a photo, special talents, and a personal history That I made up.
A lot of these dogs have rescued people from burning buildings.
This one helped Ray Charles around.
What? This cat was in Boogie Nights? - Hi.
You like this little guy? - He's so cute.
I know.
All the animal are up-to-date on their shots.
- And I think he likes you.
- He's pretty awesome.
Did you know his great-grandfather was Spuds Mackenzie? What do you think, sweetie? Do you wanna take him home? Yes, please.
Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped three to five points in the polls.
This late in the game, it's killer.
And that's a dog biscuit.
Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.
Okay, Leslie, we are out of time.
- We have to go back to them.
- Oh, my God! This is it.
Hmm.
Oh, for God's sake, Leslie.
There's just not enough money to do all the things you wanna do.
You're trying to fit two ships into one bottle.
Take it from me, you can't do that.
Okay, just look at this.
There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer.
Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.
It's an oversight.
We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.
Interesting.
Looks like we found a bigger bottle.
I know you're just making a joke, but using a bigger bottle would be considered cheating by most of our major trade publications.
FYI.
Ron, you've radiated mindfulness.
What were you thinking about? - I wasn't thinking at all.
- Incredible.
It takes a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space, no matter how hard I try.
Don't try so hard.
Don't try so hard.
Ron, I'm going to try your "not trying" method right here, right now.
Chris, wait.
I know this crap is important to you, so I should come clean.
I got nothing out of that experience at all.
So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditation Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it.
My one reservation about you as a co-worker was that you seem inflexible.
And merely by agreeing to an activity you're not interested in, you showed flexibility.
Ron, you've got the job.
- You wanna head back? - I do.
But first, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door.
I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing.
Why is it so dead? Where is everyone? Don't give up yet.
There's a few minutes left.
Is this where we drop off our unwanted cats? - No.
It's the opposite.
- Okay.
I'm just gonna put these here for a second.
And then, uh We ended up with more animals than we started with.
This is what happens when you try.
All of these animals are gonna die.
God! I hope you're happy, stupid people in this stupid town! Hey! Hey, you! Get back here and get your [Bleep] cats out of there! Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day? Probably.
I mean, I don't know how else wait a second.
Is that so am I Michelle? Hey, how is everyone? - Great! - Pretty good.
We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.
That's great news.
Let me guess.
You found room in other parts of the budget somewhere? Totally.
Got rid of a bunch of lame-ass D1's from Public Works.
Awesome news.
Hey, you know what else is pretty neat, is thanks to you, councilman Pillner went through the budget and decided that not just Public Works but all D1's will be terminated in two weeks.
- I'm getting fired.
- Ba-what now? Oh! Councilman Houser I was just looking for you.
I have found my assistant city manager.
You wanna guess who it is? It's Ron Swanson! I'm sorry.
I should've let you guess.
I'm just so excited.
I'd put a pin in this for now.
Why? Why pin it? The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.
But one of the yes votes is retiring.
If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy.
Why would he do that? He's not exactly thrilled you've been volunteering for the Knope campaign in your spare time.
Sorry, Chris.
If Newport wins You're gone.
I just need one more week.
- And then I think - Sorry, could you please Be careful? Oh, I am always careful.
We're good.
If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this.
Unfortunately, I cannot give you any more time.
With due respect Leslie, I am retiring at the end of this term, so I've been fine with you guys pushing me around on this budget thing.
But if you're ever gonna hold this job, there's something you need to understand.
City Council isn't about making everybody in town happy.
In fact, every decision you make is gonna make a lot of people very unhappy.
We play with live ammo around here.
Now I'm gonna close the book on this budget draft by the end of the business day.
So if you can find some way out of this mess by 5:00 P.
M.
, you let me know.
- Thank you.
- That's fair.
I did it! I got it out.
Oh, geez.
You don't take the ship out.
Here you go.
Chris! Great news! I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.
Here's a hint no more departments.
Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait.
Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager.
So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.
- I'm so so sorry.
- Well, that is disappointing.
But don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Oh, I know.
I mean, in the grand scheme of things, who cares? We're all just molecules, floating around in random patterns Devoid of meaning.
Well, I'll see you when I see you.
I'm a rolling stone.
- Peace.
- Stop.
Have a seat.
We did things your way, now we're gonna do it my way.
Prepare to experience true freedom and bliss.
Oh, maybe I should just go back to being a nurse full-time.
No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads.
Right.
Okay, what are you gonna do? Well, either you get fired, the Parks budget shrinks, or the animal shelter's gotta go.
Or we find money somewhere else.
Okay, Leslie, there is nowhere else.
This is a town budget, not a bottomless trust fund.
Okay? Money doesn't just appear out of nowhere.
- Shh.
Stop talking.
- What? Shh.
I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.
- Okay.
- Hey! - Do you wanna - Heh.
- I'm - No! - Do you? - Unh.
Shh.
Okay, now I have a complete idea.
Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide.
Hey, it's me.
Tommy! - Hi! - I'm not here.
April.
Swear on my great-great-grandmother's grave I'm not here.
I'm gonna come in for a second.
Can you just leave me alone? Why so glum, sugar plum? Um, I don't know.
Maybe because I worked so hard on that dumb pet adoption and I failed.
That's why it's stupid to work hard.
Let me show you something.
Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy.
And this little puppy has a home.
If Leslie's taught me anything, it's that yes, this job is frustrating and you hit brick walls.
But the other 2%, it's stuff like this kid.
And that puppy.
What what is that photo? That must come preloaded in there or something.
- Oh, my God.
- See you at work tomorrow? Fine.
All right.
Bye, pups! Bye, little piggies! I don't usually poison my body with dark alcohol, but this whiskey is excellent! Nectar of the gods.
Well, I should get back to my office.
As long as I have one.
Chris, I'm not one for positive thinking or visualization or meditation or really anything in the world that you believe in.
But you might consider the upside of losing your job.
For example? You would no longer be a government parasite, sucking the lifeblood from honest, hardworking people.
Instead, you'd contribute to society like a man.
That's just one way it might be good.
I'm sure there are others.
I'm sure there are.
Uh-oh.
You look serious.
What's on the agenda? Just one item, Jennifer.
You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.
No.
No, that's that's, um that is a great idea.
In fact, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it already.
Damn it.
Damn it! I swear the air in this town is killing my brain cells.
Actually, the water's not good for you either.
You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Has anyone told you that yet? In exchange, no more puppy killer ads for the rest of the campaign.
- That's all we ask.
- Okay.
Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads? Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget.
And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old apartment.
Okay, what's in it for you? A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget.
I wasn't born yesterday.
You've gotta have an angle.
This is a home run for us! We're gonna dominate the news cycle for a whole week.
Well, you can have this week.
We'll take the next one.
Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure? Because in a week, we have a debate.
And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth.
And I'm gonna kick his ass.
She'll take care of that.
See ya next week! How's my best buddy? Just bought this.
Cranium.
It's a board game.
Have you heard of it? It is literally the most fun I have ever had.
What do you say, after work, you, me, whiskey, wheatgrass, Cranium? - Ron? - Chris? Sorry, he's meditating.
He asked me to tell anyone who comes in that he wishes to remain undisturbed so as to better clarify his head space.
Oh, God, Ron.
I am so sorry.
I'll let you get at it.
Okay, everybody, latest poll is Newport, 40%, Leslie, 32%, with everyone else way back.
Now this debate is our best chance to close that gap.
Chris, Ann, and Tom, you guys will be talking to reporters, providing facts, general spin.
- Spin team! - Spin team! This is the best possible job for me.
I can literally make anything sound positive.
Your house just burned down, and you lost all your money in the stock market.
It's a chance to start over.
Fire is cleansing, and true wealth is measured by the amount of love in your life.
If I had to have anybody tell me that I had cancer, I would want it to be me.
Ron, April, and Andy, you'll be throwing a party for our biggest donors.
Ooh, I can't believe our house is going to be full of rich people named Dottie and Todd and Rick.
Is the menu all set? Yes, I will be providing several slabs of my world-famous Swanson ribs.
And I will be providing my world-famous $100 lap dances.
- Sweet! - No.
Okay.
The election is in two weeks.
The debate is in nine hours.
Let's get to work.
Wow.
Can't believe we're doing this here.
Seats, like, 800 people.
Well, that's what you get when your opponent's the most famous person in town.
This is a lot bigger than my high school debate auditorium.
Exact same size as the podium you use in the Parks department.
Opening statement.
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great.
I believe that I've earned your vote.
Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
- You got this.
- I got this.
You could debate Newport in your sleep.
I have.
I know.
We sleep in the same bed.
It's been hell.
I finally get a chance to stand in front of everyone and talk about the town that I love.
What if the town loves Bobby more than me? There's no way.
You're going to destroy him.
I'm going to wipe the floor with his face.
You're going to rip out his spine with your teeth and then chew it up and gargle with it.
I love it when you're needlessly disgusting.
I'm trying to clean up for the party, but I swear to God, my arms can't move that way.
Leave it messy.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
Life is garbage.
What happened? Ann broke up with me.
For reals this time.
And all I did was call into this radio station and give her a sweet little shout-out.
So we're up in the club.
It's me! We're dancing.
We're sweating.
Let's just say we got to second that night.
Kind of.
Me so horny.
This chick's name is Ann Perkins.
Look her up on the government website.
She is crazy hot.
Isn't that great? Come here.
Aah! I complimented you.
I guess she's just afraid of how powerful her feelings are.
Dude, that's not why she broke up with you.
You have to stop your stupid swagger and just tell her in a normal voice that you care about her.
What do you know? You don't care about things.
Yes, I do, I care about Andy And champion.
And I want Leslie to win, and I like sleeping.
So everybody has things they care about.
If Ann is yours, you need to tell her.
Okay, Chris, hypothetical crisis.
Leslie just tried to answer a question and audibly farted then threw up.
Spin.
Leslie Knope is literally overflowing with ideas for this town.
And speaking of methane, have you heard about her plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions? - Wow.
- Nice.
- Spin team! - Spin team! Ann and I make such a great team.
It's silly that we're not a team in real life.
I just heard those words come out of my mouth, and I have made a decision.
I've heard that you and Tom Haverford are no longer romantically involved.
Is that true? Yes, we broke up.
And I honestly can't believe we ever dated.
Does defy logic.
Okay, I still have feelings for you.
Strong feelings.
Emotional, primal feelings.
And I would like to give our relationship another try.
Chris, we dated for, like, three months a year ago.
I honestly think that you've built this into something that it wasn't.
And according to your rule, we can't date because you're my boss.
Maybe not for long.
If Newport wins, the city council may replace me.
But it would open it up for us to be together.
Would you like that? Don't answer.
Just think about it.
Come on.
Let's spin.
So you do a lot of investing? - We like to dabble.
- Mm-hmm.
I recently invested in some shirts I got at a garage sale.
Left those at Wendy's on the way home.
So The economy.
Hello.
You are here because you gave us money.
Now we will give you ribs.
Also you will watch the debate.
If you like the debate, you'll give us more money.
That is all.
Ron Swanson.
Uh-oh.
Somebody forgot to pay the cable bill.
Am I right? It was me.
Do it.
Fierce.
Power.
Pump it up.
Nothing gets me more amped than Sarah McLachlan.
Opening statement.
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town.
I've worked my whole life to make it great.
I believe I've earned your vote.
Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
I have the best campaign manager in the world.
I wouldn't say that.
Jen's a killer.
You can beat Newport.
I don't know if I can beat her.
Here's what I know.
I love you, and I like you.
I love you, and I like you.
And the home of the brave Your boy looks a little lost out there.
Oh, he'll be fine.
Expectations are crazy low.
If he puts two sentences together without crying, the press is going to say he's doing surprisingly well, and if he falls to pieces, he's going to look sympathetic.
It's a win-win.
So do you have any idea how long this is going to take? Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the event we are doing tonight, which is a city council candidate debate that we're going to start now.
I'm Perd Hapley.
And I am legendary newswoman Joan Callamezzo, newly single.
It's time for opening statements.
I am Fester Trim.
Many of you know me as the man who sells you your guns at the gun-believable Gun Emporium.
Whoo! I want to tell you about my idea for assault rifle vending machines.
You might be thinking, "what does an adult film star know about politics?" Well, I've produced and starred in over 400 adult films this year alone.
- Whoo! - Thank you.
And just like Leslie, I know what it's like to be the only woman in a room full of men.
I am Manrico Della Rossa.
I believe animals are as important as people.
And if elected, I will fight for them as if they are my own children.
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great.
I believe that I've earned your vote.
Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
And maybe that's because he's never earned anything his entire life.
That--that hurt my feelings.
Hurt my feelings.
You're supposed to be this positive person.
Can't we just talk about things we like? Well said.
Uh, just a reminder to our candidates to keep it civil.
Looking at you, Leslie.
Ah, that's okay, Joan.
I'm okay.
I'm just-- I'm nervous, man.
I'm nervous.
Gah.
I guess I want to do a good job because, um, I like it when people think I do a good job.
And I want your vote because I want Pawnee and my dad to see what I'm made of.
So let's do this.
The wrecking crew.
Who let you guys in? Hey, Jason.
Ease back.
This question about public safety comes from Twitter because apparently, that's something that happens now.
@munchmeat2015 asks, "Pawnee used 2 b safe.
"Some1 stole my car.
"What will u do "2 make Pawnee safe & can u help me find my car?" I can assure you, if you had a gun mounted on the dashboard, which automatically shot people trying to break into it, you would still have your car.
You know, I guess I would like to tell Mr.
Munchmeat that I think that stinks that happened to him.
You know, one time a guy stole some downhill skis out of my jeep.
And I was so mad, I punched a mailbox.
I'm against crime, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
I can't get through to the cable company.
Can you do something? - Like what? - Anything.
Andy's just acting out scenes from his favorite movies.
So Swayze runs, boom! Tackles the guy off the motorcycle.
Dude's like, "you're dead, bro!" Comes at him.
Swayze ducks, scissor kick.
Sha! The guy has Swayze's head.
And he says, "I used to [Bleep] guys like you in prison.
" By the looks of this guy, this is not consensual sex we're talking about.
We see bad guy had a gun the whole time.
He's like, "I'ma kill you the old-fashioned way.
" Swayze's like, "not this time.
" That's subtext.
He doesn't say that.
Bypasses the gun, hooks the arm.
Back to the secret move he used before to kill somebody, he feels so bad about it.
But this time he has to do it because it's self-defense.
K-k-k-kah! Takes the esophagus out of the neck area.
You can't eat.
You'll starve to death.
And that is Road House.
What should I do next? Leslie Knope.
This question is about Pawnee's park system.
Why is Ramsett Park so filthy and awful? It's difficult to get into the complicated problems with Ramsett Park in such a short amount of time.
- You have 20 seconds.
- Oh, my God, okay.
I will say that the parks in Pawnee-- I do have an update on your time allotment, and that update is that your time is almost gone.
I have no more time left? Well, you had some time when I started talking, but by the time I finished, your time was up.
Thank you very much.
- She's off her game.
- She's fine.
Mr.
Newport, rebuttal.
I know this.
If something is dirty, we should clean it up.
Let's start there.
Right? You know what, I had this cleaning lady named Yolanda who was very wise.
She basically raised me.
And one day she said, "little Bobby, I'm not going to clean your room no mas.
" And from that day on, my room was gross.
Really bummed me out.
I think we should make our parks look like my room after Yolanda finally, you know, gave in and cleaned it up for me.
If I may, Joan.
That's a very sweet story, Bobby, but not all of us have Yolandas who can clean up our room for us.
Some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself.
I'd just like to say that, like Leslie, I don't have people do my work for me.
Leslie and I do our work ourselves.
My work, of course, is having sex with men and women on camera.
Once again, Brandi and Leslie are essentially the same person.
But Bobby Newport is super handsome and charming, so that means people will probably vote for him because there's no justice in the world.
How do you respond to Newport's claim that the city parks need to be cleaned up? Leslie Knope works tirelessly every day, so our parks can be the best they can be.
our parks "pristine.
" And we all know the better-looking a park is, the more attention it will get from lady parks who want to have sex with it.
Excuse us.
What the hell is wrong with you? We're fighting for our lives out there.
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the fact that we just broke up, and you're already riding the Traeger train.
What are you talking about? I saw you guys getting back together.
What about us? What about us, Tom? We're not together any more because you keep acting like an ass.
I'm sorry.
I just act that way sometimes Because I'm nervous, and I feel like you're out of my league.
But I'd do anything to get back together with you.
Please.
Vote for me to be your boyfriend.
Ben, he's winning.
How is he winning? Everything he's saying is nonsense, and he's fooling them.
Okay, you're doing fine.
I need to go back on the attack.
No! No, no, no, no, no.
See, okay.
When you attacked, you kind of came off like a bully, and he looked sympathetic, so, you know, y-you did a really good job of easing off.
- Leslie, this is fun, isn't it? - Yeah.
Well, there's no reason on earth that I can think of that we shouldn't have concussion grenades in our nation's movie theaters.
By the year 2013, we will have a fully functional mall on Jupiter.
Sure, I agree that movies should be more faithful to the books that they are based on, but what does that have to do with this election? All my movies are based on books.
And anyone who even rubs their hands on a leather jacket should be tried for murder.
I'm an American.
My father is an American.
My mother is an American.
My godfather is the viceroy of the principality of Liechtenstein.
Once again, people, grenade launcher.
Daniel Craig.
No Timothy Dalton.
I was in favor of closing the borders bookstore, not the border to Mexico.
I guess my thoughts on abortion are You know, let's just all have a good time.
I don't care about that issue.
Just ask someone else.
For the record, I'd appear in a film with any of my fellow candidates.
- Anteaters.
- Kill shot.
- Money shot.
- Fudgsicles.
Let's spend our money on what matters.
Police, fire, parks, and schools.
After a rough start, your girl's doing okay.
Um, I think she's doing a little better than okay.
Or did you miss the applause she got on the raccoon safety question? Oh, that was great.
That probably pulled her even with Bobby.
I can't believe you're so casual about this.
Don't you even want to win the debate? Oh, we're gonna win the debate.
Got an ace in the hole.
- Little surprisey-wisey.
- What? Oh, you'll see.
Hey, quick question.
Does that guy Chris Traeger have a girlfriend, and is his penis normal? Stop talking.
You guys, uh, know anything about a guy named John Rambo? Open on villagers being thrown out into a rice field.
Land mines blowing them up into pieces.
After I steal this cable feed, I will repay the cable company for the service we used.
This last question before the break is for Mr.
Newport.
Uh, some--not me--have criticized your involvement with your father's candy company Sweetums.
Would your affiliation with big business affect your decisions as a city councilor? I want to run this town like a business.
My opponent, Leslie Knope, has a very anti-business agenda.
Recently, my dad told me that if Leslie Knope wins the election, they'll probably have to move Sweetums to Mexico.
That would be terrible, of course.
Thousands of people in this town would lose their jobs, and we all wouldn't have candy.
Now, I'm not saying that is gonna happen, but I do know this.
If I win I bet I could get them to stay.
Wow.
Shocking stuff.
We're gonna be back with our closing statements right after a word from our sponsor, Sweetums, Pawnee's biggest supplier of candy and jobs.
Stick around.
So Sweetums is gonna move to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win? How could they do that to this town? - What a crappy stunt to pull.
- One minute back.
What do we do? I think we attack him.
He's more confident now.
I have to attack him.
And say what? We didn't plan for this.
- What would you even say? - I don't know.
I'll figure out as I'm saying it.
Just let me attack him.
I want to attack him.
No, no, no, no.
It's too risky.
Just go with the closing statement we rehearsed.
Add a line at the end about how you're pro business, and we'll deal with the fallout tomorrow, okay? What? What's the matter with you? I can do it.
I can crush him.
I promise.
Ah, screw it.
Go get him.
- Really? - Kick his ass.
I am lineman for the county and the Wichita lineman Is still the line The final thing these candidates will say are their closing statements.
We will begin with our first candidate to go, Bobby Newport.
How do we fix this town? I have no idea.
You tell me.
That's what I'm counting on.
You telling me.
And that's how it ends.
I loved it.
It's called Babe.
And I know it sounds corny.
Talking pig.
Whatever.
You should all see it.
I feel like I just did.
It's on.
And, Leslie Knope, closing statement? I'm very angry.
I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.
It's despicable.
Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.
That power belongs to the people.
Bobby Newport and his daddy would like you to think it belongs to them.
I love this town.
And when you love something, you don't threaten it.
You don't punish it.
You fight for it.
You take care of it.
You put it first.
As your city councilor, I will make sure that no one takes advantage of Pawnee.
If I seem too passionate, it's because I care.
If I come on strong, it's because I feel strongly.
And if push too hard, it's because things aren't moving fast enough.
This is my home.
You are my family.
And I promise you I'm not going anywhere.
Holy [Bleep], Leslie, that was awesome.
Thanks, Bobby.
Yeah! Play it.
Woo-hoo! Knope 2012! Hyah! Hyah! Ron! What the voters saw tonight is an undeniable fact.
That one of these candidates is right for this town, and one of them is not.
Thanks, guys.
Ann Perkins! Uh-oh.
I'm sorry, Chris.
It's very flattering.
I just-- I just don't think it's a good idea.
It was worth a shot.
Well, I hope that whoever you end up with treats like you like the amazing person that you are.
Thank you.
And I am going to go run some stairs and work through these feelings.
- Is he sad? - Oh, my God.
He looks sad.
I'm not going out with Chris again.
Does that mean we're getting back together? No.
I don't know.
No, not right now.
There's a chance I'm never gonna date anyone ever again.
I'll take it.
And you know what else? I'm coming for you, girl JustLikeYouWant.
Just get out there and spin, man.
You got it.
Leslie Knope is scrappy like a terrier.
She's smoooooth like a blended whiskey.
My girl has big ideas and big feelings, and she's not afraid to express 'em.
- Was I too mean? - No, you were perfect.
- Leslie! - Hey! - Oh, it was amazing.
- Oh, thank you.
Hey, how was the spin room? It was a lot.
We'll talk about it.
Woo! We did it! We did it! Oh, my God, I was so nervous, but we completely go through it.
I haven't felt this good since I scored that lacrosse goal at state, seriously.
Hey, party at my dad's lake house.
Bring whoever you want.
Scrawny Christians, missionaries, come to him, and they're like, "Are you John Rambo?" He's like, "yeah.
" And they're like, "we need you to take us upriver.
" And he's like, "it's a war zone up there.
" And they're like, "yeah, we know.
We're gonna change things.
" And he's like, "you bringing any weapons?" They're like, "of course not.
" "Then you're not changing anything.
Go home.
" And then they come back in a rainstorm.
This time he says, "nope.
Go home.
" They go home again.
Bottom line, they go upriver.
Does not go well.
Okay, everybody.
Big, big news.
Uh, Leslie, would you like to do the honors? No, I think you should deliver the news.
Yeah, but you're the candidate.
Yeah, but you're the brilliant campaign manager.
- But you're the cutest.
- I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, were you going to tell us something? - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, right.
The latest poll has us only two points behind Bobby Newport! - Whoo! Yes! - Two points! I know, you guys, we only have one more day to close the gap, and we're going to do so in a one-time campaign blitz aboard the S.
S.
Knope.
This is going to be our home for the next 24 hours.
And if we win, hopefully, it will be the home - that Ben and I share forever.
- Uh, what? It's just an idea I had.
We don't have to do it.
Whatever.
We can talk about it.
Okay, here we go! We've come so far.
I want this so bad, I can taste it.
When I close my eyes, I can picture the flash of the cameras at my swearing in.
And I can hear the sound of the applause when I take my oath.
And I can see in the crowd president Obama smiling at me.
He made it.
I didn't think he would come, but he made it.
Hey, buddy.
A few days ago, on a routine campaign stop in downtown Pawnee, one Leslie Knope-- pause--was attacked-- play-- by a pie.
Luckily, it only hit Jerry, so no damage was done.
Play.
The only evidence we have is a video shot by-- pause--my wife, April Ludgate.
This is Bert Macklin's greatest assignment yet.
If you are watching, perpetrator, just know that you are still at large.
Okay, listen up, folks.
We have a security situation here.
As you know, when we reach the location, I will be conducting a security sweep.
Also, from now on, we'll be using code names.
You can address me as "eagle one.
" Ann, code name: "Been there, done that.
" April is "currently doing that.
" Donna is "it happened once in a dream.
" Chris, code name: "If I had to pick a dude.
" Ben is "eagle two.
" Oh, thank God.
No, please.
Come-- we have a problem.
The vans we rented to take senior citizens to the polls tomorrow are now, quote, "no longer available.
" What? I thought we locked those vans down, like, a week ago.
Yeah, we worked really hard to get those seniors back on our side after that ramp debacle.
- I really need their votes.
- Okay.
Tom, go down there and get those vans back.
I'll use my legendary Haverford charm.
I have total faith in you.
Take Donna with you.
Ron, you go too.
April, you are a very intelligent and savvy young woman.
I do not just think of you as just a gofer, but right now, I need you to get me a triple espresso with eight sugars.
Okay.
Wha-- I'm on it.
I'll go.
I'm going.
Please, I can go.
I don't mind.
It's better than listening to her stump speech for a millionth time.
No.
I will do it.
I have to do it.
I need to do it.
Good-bye.
This has been a difficult year for me, romantically.
Millicent Gergich, Ann Perkins, Andy's professor-- lots of disappointment, but if I keep my body moving and my mind occupied at all times, I will avoid falling into a bottomless pit of despair.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next city councilor of the great city of Pawnee, Leslie Knope! This is "eagle one," "been there, done that" is leaving the stage.
"I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it" is in position.
What do we want for our city? I'll tell you what I want.
I want better schools, I want cleaner streets, I want to expel the violent gangs of geese in Detweiler Square.
And I will finally eliminate this city's libraries! Thank you.
In the last few weeks, we've turned this campaign into a well-oiled machine.
Leslie's stump speech is 10 minutes and 40 seconds every time.
Here, check this out.
There will be a big laugh right now.
And now, a two-second awkward silence after Leslie does her Rodney Dangerfield impression.
I tell ya, these geese don't give me no respect.
No respect at all.
She insists on trying it every time, and it never works.
But the rest of the speech, fantastic.
When I was building parks, helping the community, and putting together the harvest festival, where was Bobby? He and his father, Nick Newport were exploiting this city for their personal gain.
You deserve more.
Here's the best part.
Watch what happens when she says Together, we can build a better Pawnee.
Get on your feet Everybody says they care about the issues, but at the end of the day, all anyone really wants is free clothing shot at them from a cannon.
I've been staring at this board for days.
I'm so close to putting it together.
There's got to be something we missed.
Let's go over this again.
The video shows that the pie came from a high angle, so it would've hit your face like this.
Mm-hmm.
Don't close your eyes.
Uh-- No, no.
It was actually from up higher.
Is that about right? - Yeah.
- Good.
Clean yourself up.
Let's do this again.
Hey, Bill! Tom Haverford from the Knope campaign.
And you brought the whole posse with you, huh? I'm not changing my mind.
We already paid for those vans, Mr.
Butler.
$900 for one day.
Yeah, it was $900, but now it's $10,000.
Excuse me? The Newport campaign offered me 10 grand to just rent the vans and park them somewhere.
So I'm going to tear up your contract, and I'm going to take the money.
Anything else? No? Great.
Well, what now? He's just playing hardball.
Let me tell you how it's gonna go down.
In a few minutes, we'll walk in there, we'll give him our demands, and then, bam! I start crying.
We need the vans, so please, give the vans, please? We need the vans.
And if elected, I promise to stop the Newports and Sweetums from blatantly dumping contaminants into the Pawnee river.
Leslie, can you comment on Bobby's father Nick Newport? Nick Newport has been intimidating and bullying and poisoning this town for years.
Frankly, he's a real jerk, and if he thinks he can buy this election for his son, he's wrong.
Sorry, I meant can you comment on Nick Newport dying earlier today? He died? I Sad.
Is that your official statement? "I sad"? No, my official statement is that is overall, a bummer.
Oof.
And--and together we can build a better Pawnee.
- Get on your feet - No, this is isn't the time.
No, guys.
Get up and make it happen Frankly, he's a real jerk.
Harsh words, but this reporter does love those t-shirt cannons.
Now, Jen, what are your thoughts about all of this? This is not a time for politics.
I am calling on Leslie Knope to cancel all of her campaign events out of respect for the Newport family.
Anything else would be a classless move, on par with spray-painting nipples on the Lincoln memorial.
Okay, emergency meeting.
I need everyone to gather around me in order of how much I trust them.
Here's the situation.
A man has died.
But that man is 98 years old, and he's an awful man.
However, he is a man, and he died.
Also, you called the dead man a jerk.
However, he was a jerk.
He put a lot of people out of work, he had tons of mistresses, he polluted this town.
Okay, Ben, what do we do? Okay, it's unfortunate, but the stakes are too high.
We can't just stop campaigning.
We stop, we lose.
Good answer, great body.
Ann, try to beat what he said.
I'm not going to beat him.
Not with that attitude.
Okay, fine.
I think you should stop.
At least until you apologize to Bobby in person.
April? I wasn't listening, but I strongly disagree with Ann.
Andy? If the--if the guy--if-- Okay.
I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.
The worst possible thing we could do would be to stop, 'cause if the campaign stops, we all stop.
And stopping is certain death.
Who wants a panini? Anyone? Everyone? I'm going to say everyone.
All right.
All right, Leslie, what's your call? Ann, there is nothing harder in the entire world than saying no to your beautiful face.
But I'm going to.
No! We're going to keep campaigning.
Okay, but we're going to do it in a classy and respectful way to get Ann off of our backs.
What's next on the "schedge?" If you let Newport have the vans, they just sit there in a lot.
If you let us have the vans, they drive around town all day.
Free publicity.
Everyone will see your logo.
Which is you all pressed up on some chick with huge cans.
Yeah.
It was a hell of a day.
People need to know about it.
And I don't need free publicity.
I can just pay for it.
With my $10,000.
Look, I ain't gonna try to play a player.
You're trying to get beaucoup bucks just like the rest of us.
So how about this? I have a business idea for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.
I call it Yogurt platinum.
I'll let you in on the ground floor.
And let me tell you, it's going to be worth way more than 10 grand.
Yeah, but now that I know your bad idea, I can start the company myself.
With my $10,000.
No, you can't do that! Ron! Tom, Donna, could you please give us a moment? I'd like to talk to Bill, man to man.
He's gonna steal yogurt platinum.
No, I'm not.
"We're all your friends," said Mr.
bacon.
"Welcome home.
" The end.
And that is Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative.
Any questions? Yes? How did Groffle cross the syrup river? And why did you call Mr.
Newport a jerk? Ah--well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people.
I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but-- I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler.
Ms.
Knope, I have a follow-up to what I'm now deciding to call "jerk-gate.
" Are there any other deceased members of Bobby Newport's family you'd like to attack? And quit ducking the waffle question.
Did Groffle use a boat of some kind? All right, that's all the questions for now.
Thank you, everybody.
Are we to assume that he swam across the syrup river? Ms.
Knope! I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.
It's obvious what you need to do.
You have to apologize to Bobby and stop campaigning.
Okay, fine.
We go to Bobby Newport, you apologize Good.
And then we leak the details to the press, which restores your reputation and buys us enough time - to finish the bus tour.
- Nice.
No, that's not a real apology.
It's just sneaky.
I don't like it.
Ann, for once, this is not about you.
A man is dead.
Look, friend, I respect your slavish devotion to the free market, but you can't welch on a contract.
Where I come from, a man's word is sacred.
Okay, what's your stance on pinky swears, George Washington? I'm taking the money.
Fine.
I'll match it.
I'll give you $10,000 for the vans.
Deal? No.
Price has gone up.
Now it's $12,000.
What? Why? Look, I own a fleet of 22 crappy white vans, and for some reason there's a massive bidding war going on over them.
Now for a guy whose only assets are 22 crappy white vans, it's pretty much a dream scenario, so I'm just going to ride this out, see where it takes me.
And now it's 15,000.
Okay, I talked Newport's people into giving us ten minutes alone with Bobby, so we get in there, we apologize, and then we get back on the campaign trail.
Okay, how do we leak this to the press? Do we, like, release a statement? Do we call somebody? Um, I don't think that's going to be a problem.
Oh, my God, why are there so many people here? It's a trap.
It's a trap! We got to get out of here.
Turn around! Turn around! This is a time of solemnity and remembrance.
This is not a time for politi-- Oh, wow.
Leslie Knope is driving her campaign bus through a memorial service.
- Back it up! - Back it up! - Okay, back up! - Back it up! Just when we thought she couldn't stoop any lower.
Just--oh! - Oh! - Aah! - Uh - Go forward! Go forward! Go forward! I feel like he's dying all over again.
- Stop it! - Ah! - Oh.
- Oh, no.
Hi Sorry, are we late? So I--I hate to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I'm going to get paid.
It was a handshake agreement with Mr.
Newport.
It was for a lot of money.
Anyway, you can wire-transfer it.
Sorry for your loss.
I can't believe you turned this situation into a political sideshow.
Oh, come on, you guys were only going to apologize for the press.
No way, that's not us.
You don't know us at all.
It's rude to say it.
We wouldn't even think it.
Yeah, that's a ridiculous claim.
We brought a "sorry for your loss" fruit basket for Bobby.
And it is very classy.
No melon, no apples.
You were going to use us, and we just turned the tables on you.
'Cause I'm smarter and faster.
That is not a judgment.
That's just a fact.
We're both just doing whatever it takes to win, right? I love polka dots.
It's so cute.
I'm sorry, I should have seen this coming.
And we should not have driven here on a bus with your face on it.
No, it's my fault.
And you know what? Jen is right.
I'm no better than her.
No, Leslie, yes, you are.
All you need to do is stop the machine for a second and go apologize to Bobby.
Alone without cameras.
Thanks, Ann, but where was that advice six hours ago? That's not going to work.
I had to try.
April.
I just got Champion his dog food, cleaned your house, filed that paperwork-- you're officially April Ludgate Dwyer, installed a smoke detector, and now I'm back.
What's next? Nothing, Chris.
Just sit down somewhere and stop bothering me.
I can't.
I've had a very tough year.
I can't stop thinking about Ann and Millicent.
And if I'm alone with my thoughts, I go to a dark place.
Okay, first of all, dark places are awesome.
Secondly, Ann is kind of lame, so way to dodge a bullet.
And Millicent is Jerry's daughter, so two bullets.
And you're not alone.
You've got lots of friends.
Somewhere.
I assume.
You're going to be just fine.
Thank you.
You're right.
I'll be fine.
I'm not fine.
It didn't work.
Hey, Bobby.
Oh, hi.
Want to play bowling? Why don't you play with the real one? Oh.
I like this one better.
The little guy looks like me.
See? Hey, can we talk for a second? Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk.
That's okay.
He was, like, a million years old.
And he was kind of a jerk.
The only reason I did this campaign was to impress him, and he couldn't have cared less.
You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid.
So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it.
And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event.
And I finished dead last.
And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.
But she wasn't.
She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me.
Thanks, Leslie.
That's a great story.
I'm not 100% sure I get the point, but-- You finished this race, Bobby.
The campaign is over, and you finished.
Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you.
Now I get it.
There you go.
Your mom and my dad are both dicks.
There's no vans within 50 miles, and, for some reason, no one wants to lend me $10,000.
Even if we had the dough, that bunco artist would just demand more, trust me.
Don't move.
Let's just stay here.
For like an hour, and not let him out.
This isn't right.
Our girl's worked hard.
We're so close.
I know he didn't just hit my baby! Hey! What the hell, guys? Move! All right.
Y'all got your seat belts on? Oh! Did you see that? That son of a bitch just rear-ended me.
Am I dead? What the hell? Exactly, Bill.
What the hell? You just rear-ended me.
That is not what happened.
- But I got witnesses.
- Yeah.
It went down exactly the way my girl said it did, you mean, bald man.
Hey, what about you, Mr.
"A man's word is sacred"? Well, it is, but you're an ass[Bleep].
So we can settle this now.
I will accept payment in van rentals.
Gah! All right, let's go to the video again.
Sweet kick, Leslie exits the building, and then you get hit.
What else do we know? We know that Leslie was about 15 feet in front of you, so clearly the assailant has terrible aim.
Mm-hmm.
Or Leslie wasn't the target.
Well, who then? Okay, that's permanent marker.
Go find Ben, get a list of everyone he's ever fired.
Go, go! Macklin, you son of a bitch.
A lot of people have been asking me how I feel about everything that's happened today.
Well, let me tell you a little story.
My dad was this amazing athlete when he was a kid.
When I was in junior high, I started doing track just to impress him Even though I hated it.
At the end of the year, I entered the 5,000 meters.
And I won.
It was awesome.
My dad wrapped me in a big hug, said he was proud of me.
That's just a great story that happened between me and my dad and nobody else.
Oh, we're dead.
- It's over.
- That's my story.
Before I go, I want to bring up a special guest.
Somebody who's been very supportive and mega cool today.
Leslie Knope.
Will you come up here? - What? - Come on, come up here.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Do-- You know, Leslie's been getting a lot of heat today, but I want you all to know that we talked person-to-person, and she's really great.
People should stop being so mean to her.
In fact, if you don't vote for me tomorrow, you should vote for her, because she's super, super awesome lady.
Leslie, we did it! Yeah! Maybe we're not dead.
Chris, right? Hi, I'm Jen.
Hello.
You know, there are Bobby's in one, there's a dead guy in another, the rest are free.
What do you say? Oh! That is very flattering.
But you're the opposition campaign manager.
I--I couldn't do that to Leslie.
Oh, for God's sake, Chris.
This campaign is over.
My job is done and so is yours.
It's just sex.
I'm very good at it.
- Okay.
- Great! Let's do it.
Haven't got all day, honey.
Sewage Joe.
Ben Wyatt fired you for sending pictures of your penis to everyone, and you've come here to "pie" him.
Little twerp has it coming.
Oh, dude, I dare you.
Please.
Give me one reason to take you down.
I would love nothing more-- Oh, [Bleep].
Ben, sorry.
All right, let's go.
Oh, I did it! Yeah.
Great job.
I will certify the results after all the precints have reported.
A final tally within 1% would trigger an automatic recount.
In the event of an exact tie, the seat is awarded to the male candidate, and the female candidate is put in jail.
Once again, I have to object.
I don't think it would hold up in court, but it is city law.
- Any questions? - Yes, actually.
At the 11th hour the Newports are trying to install these voting machines at several precincts around town.
Watch what happens when I vote for Bobby Newport.
Good choice.
Enjoy a voucher for a complimentary Sweetums candy bar.
Shouldn't we be rewarding our citizens for voting? I'm never against anyone getting a candy bar, but watch what happens when you vote for me.
Are you sure? Take a second and think it over.
Then you have to press it again.
To cancel your vote and select someone better, press the Sweetums logo.
I'm sorry.
I just don't see the problem.
Bobby Newport and I are separated by a razor-thin margin.
Could go either way.
I've only slept nine hours over the past four days, so I'm right on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
This isn't a bagel.
Party starts at 7:00 in the historic Jermaine Jackson Ballroom at the Pawnee Supersuites.
It is no longer "A Pimps n' Hoes" pajama party.
That idea was nixed by a certain uptight nerd who shall remain nameless.
By 10:00, we should know if Leslie won the election, but more importantly, tonight, Ann and I are getting back together.
Oh, right, because of the dream you had? Last night at approximately 2:30 A.
M.
, I woke up from a dream that felt so real that it had to be a premonition.
Me, Drake, and the T-mobile girl were playing baccarat on a private jet.
Ann Perkins walks up to me, and she says, "Tommy, tomorrow night, I'm taking you back.
" Then Blue Ivy Carter high-fived me and gave me $40 million.
It was all so real.
The reason why Bobby and I are appearing together is to send the message that everyone should get out and vote no matter who they're voting for.
That's right.
Another awesome point by Leslie.
That's why I'm voting for you.
What's so funny? They're laughing at your joke.
What joke? I am voting for you.
You're not voting for yourself? Leslie, you can't vote for yourself, I don't think.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Anything else? Hey, you did an unbelievable job on this campaign, Ben.
My partners back in Washington think so too.
Well, Leslie gets the credit.
Not me.
Look.
Your opponent is legendarily stupid and I phoned it in pretty hard, but you have a knack for this.
I'm running congressman Murray's reelection bid.
Ohio, 19.
I need someone to coordinate out of D.
C.
You want to do it? Yeah, that sounds great, but the Pacers called, and they're asking me to be their starting point guard.
I'm being serious, Ben.
What? What, you trust me with a congressional campaign? Is this a trick? No.
This is a job offer.
Give me your answer soon.
I need you in Washington in two days.
Look at that thing.
What is that? Don't touch it.
Ann Perkins.
Can I ask your advice on something? Sure.
Recently in a moment of weakness, I had sex with Bobby Newport's campaign manager Jennifer Barkley.
Seriously? Yes.
Several times.
And then several more times.
And then a couple more times.
And then one more time.
How has this been going on? Oh, it was just last night.
Now, I know it's a one-night stand and that she's leaving town, but our ferocious sexual decathlon did radically improve my mood.
And I kind of like to see her again before she leaves.
Good idea? Bad idea? I don't know.
I guess the campaign's over, so I suppose it couldn't hurt.
Ann Perkins.
April! Got your message.
Where are you? Under the table.
Why are you hiding? Should I hide too? What's going on? I was supposed to copy all the department files onto a thumb drive, and it kept freezing, and I got annoyed, and I don't know what happened, but all the files are gone on every computer.
They're all gone.
Babe, they're all gone.
Okay, okay.
Calm down.
First of all, you did the right thing by hiding under this table.
Secondly, your man is here.
I'm gonna take care of this for us.
I've been playing Xbox for years.
I'm really good at fixing it when it freezes.
I know exactly what to do.
Try it now.
I don't know.
I feel like I'm forgetting something.
What about my speeches? Finished both of them last night.
One if you win, one if you lose.
What if I tie? You need to write a tie-speech for me, something about the poetic nature of democracy and how I'm going fight this thing from my prison cell-- Leslie, relax.
We're done.
All that's left is the waiting.
Okay? What were you talking to Jen about? Oh, nothing.
No, I just-- yeah, nothing.
She-- she's-- nothing.
Nothing.
It's nothing.
Hey, what's a good place to buy jeans? You have plenty of jeans.
What were you talking about? Jen offered me a job working on a congressional campaign Oh, my God, that's amazing.
In Washington.
What? Are you happy or angry? I don't know.
I don't know.
What did you say? Did you say, "yes?" I haven't had a chance to think about it.
I mean, it sounds amazing, but you know, six months in Washington, D.
C.
Away from you, but you know, we should talk about it.
Yeah.
We'll just talk about it.
You know, we'll mull it over, we'll look at it from every side.
Et cetera, et cetera.
Just-- I'm going to go vote, just fulfill a lifelong dream of mine and achieve one of my all-time happiest moments real quick, and then we will talk about it.
Cool.
Leslie, I can't figure this thing out.
Can you help me? Yeah, just hang on a second, Bobby.
Ink all over my hands, and the pen thing-y came off the chain.
I don't get it! The polls have just closed, and now we're getting results in the race for city council.
With just 1% of the precincts reporting, adult film star Brandi Maxxxx has a commanding lead.
Oh, my God.
That's it.
It's not Bobby Newport who's going to beat me, it's Brandi Maxxxx, the porn star.
What is this? Italy? Listen, I know you're stressed out, and I figured you would be, so I took the liberty of arranging a fun little activity for us.
- You did? - Mm-hmm.
Oh, Ann.
Thank you so much.
I've said this to you before, and I know it makes you uncomfortable Oh, boy.
But you're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot.
Okay, let's go.
Another, Dana, please and thank you.
Ron, I handed out That is a personal best.
Now I'm off to vote.
The polls are closed.
What? No, no, no.
I thought that they close at 8:00.
Oh, my God.
Ron, I didn't get to vote for Leslie.
Oh, my God, what do I do? Nothing you can do.
Except hope Leslie doesn't lose by one vote.
and it's razor-thin and getting razor-thinner.
Oh, boy.
No.
No.
Jen Barkley.
Hey.
What are you doing here? That was fun last night, you old screamer.
There were moments that I didn't fully understand some of the physical shapes that we were making Mm.
But the sensations were amazing.
- So I just went with it.
- Great.
Well, I thought that we could just talk before you left town if that's okay.
No, but there's a supply room over there with a futon.
Great.
Not yet.
Just wait-- we're just getting supplies.
Anybody need anything? Pushpins-- okay, good.
Please hurry.
I told her it's a matter of life and death.
Honey, Donna's been here forever.
She's going to know what to do.
What if she doesn't? I could get fired.
Or even worse, Leslie might give me a lecture on responsibility again, I can't do it.
I'll tell you what, honey.
Here's the deal.
You get fired, I'll quit.
We'll leave together.
I'm serious.
Move to a new city.
Change our names, burn our fingertips off with acid, swap faces.
- What? - If we have to.
Good.
Yes.
Nice.
Keep punching.
- Did I hit your boob? - No.
Sorry.
Great form.
Maybe.
I have no idea actually.
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Yeah! That was good.
I'm exhausted.
How long was that? Boy, that's disappointing.
What are you going to do about Ben? I just-- I've been running for office the entire time we've been dating.
We're just about to get our lives back.
It would kill me if he left.
Then tell him that.
Go find him and tell him how you feel.
And then the two of you could work it out together.
Election results, Ann.
Ann, Ann, I can't read it.
- Okay.
- Ann, my hands.
My hands, Ann.
- Here.
- They're in these round gloves.
Here.
Okay.
Bobby Newport is up by 140 votes.
Okay.
Let's get your hands back up.
- Okay.
- Go another eight seconds.
Oh, God, I'm so tired.
Gin and tonic, please.
Belay that order, Dana.
Lagavulin, neat.
Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
What's on your mind, son? Well, Jen Barkley offered me a job in Washington.
A great job, but I think Leslie wants me to stay.
What would you do? Well, I've never been one for meeting new people or doing new things or eating new types of food or traveling outside of southern Indiana.
I've had the same haircut since 1978, and I've driven the same car since 1991.
I've used the same wooden comb for three decades.
I have one bowl.
I still get my milk delivered by horse.
You do? But you and Leslie like to hold hands and jump off of cliffs together into the great unknown.
You two have a good relationship.
I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet.
So you really want things to just stay exactly the same? But if Leslie wins, you get my old job, assistant city manager, right? Seems that way.
Then good luck to the both of us.
Hey--uh! Hmm! I have an update that contains new information.
With 74% of the precincts reporting, Leslie Knope is now winning by 192 votes.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, lord, please, please.
Let her win.
Please, lord.
Please, lord, let her win.
Please let her win.
I'm just going to say this.
And I realize this after speaking with my best friend and relationship advisor Ann Perkins from the department of health.
Yes, I know Ann.
I don't want you to go to Washington.
I know it's an amazing opportunity, but in just a few minutes, all this craziness is going to be over, and I just want to have dinner with you.
Like normal people.
Yeah, then I won't go.
Really? Yeah.
Easy.
I mean, I was on the fence about it anyway.
Washington's really far away, and I don't know if I want to work with Jen.
I mean, this just seals the deal.
I'll stay.
Oh, thank God.
What a relief.
Guys.
It's been neck-in-neck, too close to call all night, but now we're ready to make a call in the race for city council.
Bobby Newport Oh, no.
Scion of the Sweetums candy empire and amateur go-kart champion has won the race.
Why are you laughing? Because my dream is dead.
Oh, oh.
Oh, [Bleep].
Recount! There's a recount.
Oh, come on.
It's over.
Just concede.
Newport won by 21 votes.
That's well within the margin for a recount.
Please don't do this.
I really want to get out of here.
How about this-- why don't I make you guys a deal? Okay, there's no deal in the world that we would ever possibly-- I'll give you Joe Biden's home phone number.
Now, hang on.
That's interesting.
No, no, you're not thinking clearly.
Mr.
Commissioner, the recount has to start immediately.
It's the law.
Now I'm not leaving until you make the call.
He's right, Ms.
Barkley.
It'll start right away.
- Keep your phones on.
- Terrence! I just want to go home.
Hey, any news? They said the recount could take two hours, but who knows.
Man, this is stressful.
I picked the wrong week to do a juice cleanse.
Okay, I think Leslie should say something to the troops just to get everyone's spirits up.
- Where is she? - I don't know.
She's not answering her phone.
What? No one knows where she is? That's a nice chair.
Corinthian leather, solid mahogany frame with what I believe are hand-cut mortise and tenon joints pinned with oak.
I was really looking forward to sitting in it.
Figured this might be my last chance.
You don't know that.
Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard.
Every five-minute coffee break at work, every night, every weekend, every spare moment of their lives, they gave to me.
If I lose, I'll never forgive myself.
You deserve to win.
We didn't volunteer to help you because we wanted to wrap ourselves in personal glory.
We did it because wecare about you.
You had a dream, and we wanted to support your dream.
That's what you do when you care about someone.
You support them, win, lose, or draw.
Let's go back to the party.
You drive.
I've had 11 whiskeys.
Okay.
That's good on places to live.
Let's go back to dream jobs.
If we had to start a new life, I have Detective, FBI agent, policeman, CIA agent.
So we need more for you.
Let's go.
- Andy, I-- - It's fun.
I'm trying to help you take your mind off of this horrible mistake you made deleting all these files, probably the worst thing to ever happen in Parks and Rec history.
You will certainly get fired, and I'm trying to help.
God.
So dream jobs, go.
Dream big, kid! Fine.
Uh, dental hygienist who's also a medium, so I can clean people's teeth and tell them when they're going to die.
That's brilliant.
Let's make this fast.
I almost made it with Councilman Howser before you interrupted us.
Which files did you delete? All of them.
I just put the stupid flash drive in, and then I tried to drag everything over, and-- Fixed it.
- What? - What? How? Jerry accidentally deletes things all the time.
Ten years ago, I installed my own secret backup.
- You saved us, Donna.
- Oh.
- I love you.
- Oh.
Okay.
Bring it in, boy.
There you are.
Thank God.
We're going to get the final results any minute.
I know.
Do you have both my speeches? Yes.
You seem calmer than I expected you'd be.
I got you something.
Let me open it for you.
You have to go to Washington.
I told you I'm turning it down.
I was being selfish.
You put your whole life on hold for me.
The very least I can do is try to return the favor.
Are you sure about this? We can make it work.
I will visit you, then you come visit me.
And then I go visit you again.
And then we make out in the Lincoln bedroom And the Jefferson Memorial and the Supreme Court gallery.
We'll do it all over Washington.
Thank you.
Where did you get a Washington Monument figurine at midnight on a Tuesday? From my office.
I have, like, 50 of them.
Right.
The recount's over.
They just called the race.
Oh, God.
It's still 21 votes.
But you won.
You won, Leslie.
You won by 21 votes.
It's confirmed.
It's over.
You won.
That was really sneaky, Ann.
I know.
I couldn't resist.
Honestly, I've never been more relieved in my entire life.
I didn't ruin it.
I thought I ruined it, but I didn't ruin it.
You're kind of ruining it now.
Great.
That is great news.
I'm going to see you in D.
C.
- Yeah, I guess you will.
- Yeah.
Oh, damn it.
Didn't get a chance to say good-bye to Chris.
Oh, he's just right over there.
Eh.
He seems really busy.
Anyway, would you tell him I said good-bye? Great! Thank you.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet.
- I'm Ann.
- That doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.
Congratulations, Mr.
Assistant City Manager.
I'm very grateful, Chris, but I think I'm going to turn down the job.
Really? Why? I like where I am.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Did someone just talk about a job opening? Because guess who's got two thumbs and was just cleared from insurance fraud? This guy, you know? Got off on a technicality What's the gig? I'm in.
There's no job for you.
Smart move.
Go with your gut.
All right? I'll talk to you guys soon.
Your victory speech, Councilwoman Knope.
Some day, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me.
I never wrote it.
And I know all of you know how hard she worked to get here.
She is the next city councilwoman from the great city of Pawnee, ladies and gentlemen, my best friend in the world, Leslie Knope.
The idea behind this campaign was a simple one: That with hard work and positivity, a group of people can make a difference during my term as your city councilor Thank you.
I want to focus on your hopes and not your fears.
I want to solve problems instead of creating friction.
And I will work hard every hour of every day to make Pawnee a better place to live because I love this city.
And I know firsthand, how very special the people of this city are.
I owe this victory, all of it, to my friends and my supporters.
No one achieves anything alone.
So let's embark on a new journey together.
Let's break out a map.
Not the old, out-of-date one that shows where we've been, but a crisp new one that shows where we might go.
Let's embark on a new journey together and see where it takes us.
Tommy! This party was amazing, you're amazing.
You are ridiculous, but I like you, and I think that we should date--all of it.
Let's do it.
Let's date.
This is my dream.
Nostra-Thomas is happening.
- Awesome.
- Hey, let's move in together.
Phhhht! Totally.
- Really? - Yeah.
All right, no take-backs when we sober up, little partner.
No take-backs, partner.
We're cowboys.
Great win, great night.
Great year.
Hot wife.
Jackpot.
Good job, me.
Oh, my God.
Babe.
You know what? Almost everything you wrote on that board as a dream job was some type of police officer.
Yeah.
You ready to go? No, listen to me.
- Mm-hmm.
- How does this sound? "Officer Dwyer, Pawnee PD.
" Guys, we're going to JJ's for victory waffles, and then we're staying up all night talking about our lives and our feelings.
Nonnegotiable.
Let's go! City council, bitches! - Jerry forgot to vote.
- Damn it, Jerry.
